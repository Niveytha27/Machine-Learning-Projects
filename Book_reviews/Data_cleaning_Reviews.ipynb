It came at the second place and I adored “ Midnight Library” too. But this one still has special place in my heart! It’s still my favorite fiction reads of the year! Good news: This amazing is about to be adapted in Swedish series. And fingers crossed, I hope Netflix buys this limited series so we may enjoy them! This is one of my favorite, highly recommended fiction novels of 2020! I think my vocabulary is so limited to express how this book made me feel. Yes, it shook me so hard but it also entertained the hell of me. It was tragic, tear jerker, but it was also funny, enjoyable, witty! It was action packed, riveting, heart throbbing but it was also thought-provoking, complex, dazzling, deceptive, educational and heartfelt.I know you got confused. How a book makes laugh so hard and then makes you cry like a baby and also hooks you up from its riveting, exciting chapters and at some parts you want to stop, taking a deep breath to absorb what you read, aching for characters, feeling their pain but you’re also laughing their ridiculousness! This book captivates your heart, brain and your soul at the same time and plays with your emotional balance, juggling between different genres and you just want to clap the author and take a bow for his remarkable, original, unique work.His sarcastic, witty and dark sense of humor reminded me of Guy Ritchie’s crime/dark comedy scripts (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch) and his quirky, sarcastic, awkward characters slowly warms your heart and entertains the hell of you! As soon as I finish it, I turned back and reread the police interrogation parts of the book and I laughed over and over!!!So what this book is about? Bunch of idiot people? YESAn unsuccessful bank robbery attempt and hostage situation? YES. What a minute! If the robbery is unsuccessful, how the thief managed to take hostages? And how many hostages he has? 8 hostages!Is this book about suicide attempts on the bridge? YES!Is this about stock markets, mortgages, banking system and destroying effects of capitalism makes rich people richer and makes you poor… yes, you may fill the blanks…! YES!I guess you must be confused again but don’t! Even though the book looks like a puzzle, all the pieces find their right place and so many twists that you may not foresee confuse you more but at the end you realize you read something so spectacular make you question your morals, your judgments, beliefs, the way you look at the life and test your decency.Jack and Jim, police officers, son and father, carrying Whiskey brand names, are anxious people who are not happy about their lives, polar opposites, barely stand with each other but unfortunately they are still colleagues and they’re interrogating hostages about the whereabouts of the bank robber. Oh sorry, the guy couldn’t rob the bank because the bank didn’t have enough money and young intern just called the cops so the unsuccessful bank robber runs into an apartment viewing. 8 people seeing the house become the worst bank robber’s reluctant hostages. But I have to admit they are the WORST BATSHIT CRAZY HOSTAGES you may imagine!Jack and Jim surrounded the building with their colleagues, called the big guns from Stockholm to save the hostages from another syndrome but they hear gun shot and when they go to check the building, they see the blood stains in the living room but amateur bank robber (you’re gonna understand my reasoning why I keep tell the robber this silly name after reading this book!) is nowhere to be seen. So Jack thinks one of the hostages helped the first time robber. Or they may hide something from them.So we’re moving back and forth between interrogations, the hostages’ back stories, secrets, the reasons behind they want to see the house. And naturally my favorite hostages are sarcastic, direct, cruel, smart, entertaining, cool Zara and golden-hearted Estelle (I wish she would be my grandma and her story broke my heart into pieces)The ending of the story (or let’s say new beginnings of the characters’ stories) was surprising but also heart melting, memorable, tear jerking. And I forget to add what this book is about… IT IS ABOUT REAL LOVE…Thanks to Atria Books/Simon Schuster for sending this special ARC to me in exchange my honest review. I love this author’s works so much and this is one of the best books I’ve read on 2020.bloginstagramfacebooktwitter ...more 2 - 2.5 StarsI am definitely in the minority on this and I am very aware of that...all I can say is, Backman can really write (although I already knew that). And he can really write people. Which I also knew...The problem was I just didn\\'t actually like any of the people here. Or the plot. Now, I\\'m not saying I always have to like all the people in a story to like the story itself. But when I not only dislike the people, but think they are completely obnoxious?

And he can really write people. Which I also knew...The problem was I just didn\\'t actually like any of the people here. Or the plot. Now, I\\'m not saying I always have to like all the people in a story to like the story itself. But when I not only dislike the people, but think they are completely obnoxious? And I think the plot is ridiculous and makes bumbling idiots of everyone involved?  And, yes, I am aware the characters were supposed to be bumbling idiots. The narrator calls them idiots multiple times throughout the book. It was a theme. After all, we are all idiots at what time or another, right? *wink wink* See what Backman I did there? *nudge nudge* (All throughout the book, mind you.) I know all the quirkiness was supposed to give me all the feels and and all that. Instead, it just grated on me. Now, to be clear, I didn\\'t outright hate this or anything. As I said, the writing was superb. I thought there were a lot of cute moments and I really liked some of the narratives Backman explored about life, human nature, the human condition in a modern world, and anxiety as a whole. My love for those things just didn\\'t offset my general sense of annoyance at the characters and the plot enough. But, oh well. As I said, I am definitely in the minority on this one. I know most people loved this. And if you think you might too, you should absolutely give it a go. I will definitely read more Backman in the future. This was just a miss for me, that\\'s all.EDITED: Because I am sick of repeating this in the comments, I\\'m adding this here...I\\'m not stupid, folks. I understood why the characters were acting like idiots. I understand they were (view spoiler)[purposefully behaving that way to protect the true \"robber\" (hide spoiler)]. I didn\\'t \"miss it\" and thus not like the story because of it. I understood what was happening. I \"got\" was Backman was doing. I don\\'t need it explained to me. The characters - regardless of their motivations - just annoyed me and I did not like the book. It\\'s that simple. I thought I made this clear enough in my review, but I guess not.

I\\'m so grateful that I got to share my love for this book with my book buddy and am so glad that Kaceey loved this book as much as I did. *5 Powerful Stars“Anxious People” is a thought provoking, heart-wrenching, comical novel that leaves you in wonderment. It’s Fredrik Backman at his best.  At its heart, this book deals with human connection and the impact people have on each other. It showcases Mr. Backman’s talent in an entirely new way and it is another reminder as to why he is one of my favorite authors. Fredrik Backman is an author who has an innate ability to capture the human spirit, get under his characters’ skins and relay his characters thoughts and feelings in a way that makes us feel as if we know them, as if we are friends with them and at times, as if we are them. “Anxious People” is different from Backman’s other novels, there are no quirky curmudgeons like Ove or Britt-Marie and there are no Benji’s. This story features a Bank Robber, a Hostage Situation, a Real Estate Agent and an entire cast of other extremely complicated characters. This is a character driven novel and it delves into the trials and tribulations of each individual whose lives are affected by the situation that they are in. I had no idea what I was in for when I dived in - what I will say is that each and every character will steal your heart. It’s that thing called human connection. Within just a few minutes of reading this, tears pricked my eyes and I knew from that moment on that this book was special. It is wild and crazy and unlike anything you’ve ever read. At times you will be exasperated and yet you will keep reading. One minute you will be laughing and the next you will be in tears. For me, it happened and happened often. Once again, Fredrik Backman does something special here and I’m so very grateful for it.  “Anxious People” is a must read and will most certainly be on my Goodreads Best of List for 2020. This novel reminded me that everything I do can potentially impact others and therefore, I must think before I act. It also reminded me how important human connection is and how grateful I am for the relationships I have built with all of you. Though times are difficult right now, I am thankful that we have each other. I wish you all good health, peace and safety. Namaste. A huge thank you to Ms. Ariele Friedman at Atria Books and NetGalley for the arc. Thank you also to Fredrik Backman for continuing to write such incredible words. You inspire me.Published on Goodreads on 5.9.2020. ...more Anxious People by Fredrik Backman hit me right in the part of me that I never want to discuss, the part that I don\\'t even know how to discuss. He knows how we feel at our lowest moments, during our biggest and smallest times of disappointment, grief, and feelings of despair. Yet, rather than bringing me down, he lightens my heart because we aren\\'t alone in these feelings. There is humor in how we feel and there is hope in low times. This book made me laugh and I loved it.\\xa0So now, watch me call a Anxious People by Fredrik Backman hit me right in the part of me that I never want to discuss, the part that I don\\'t even know how to discuss. He knows how we feel at our lowest moments, during our biggest and smallest times of disappointment, grief, and feelings of despair. Yet, rather than bringing me down, he lightens my heart because we aren\\'t alone in these feelings. There is humor in how we feel and there is hope in low times. This book made me laugh and I loved it.\\xa0So now, watch me call all of us idiots because Backman makes such good points about the subject. We aren\\'t alone in our idiot-ness, though. That could be beside the point or it could be THE point . Things happen, mistakes are made, but sometimes we can do things that alter the path of those mistakes before they become so destructive that we can\\'t pull back from the black hole we are facing.\\xa0There is a very reluctant bank robber-to-be and when attempting to rob a bank, the bank robber makes the biggest mistake a bank robber can make. So the failed bank robber runs and accidently takes an apartment of people hostage. The now hostage taker is having a very bad day, worse than the bad day they were having before they tried to rob a bank. And the hostages! The hostages are the worst! What is wrong with these people!\\xa0We learn more about the hostage taker and the hostages and I loved it all. The two police officers, who later try to question the former hostages, are at their wits ends. The former hostages won\\'t answer questions, they talk in circles, they ask their own very unhelpful questions, it\\'s obvious that they are idiots and the police officers feel like they are idiots, too. How can so much go wrong and where is the bank robber/hostage taker? How did they escape from a closed area, with only one guarded exit. Just what is going on?Publication: September 8, 2020Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley for this ARC. ...more ****FINALIST IN THE GOODREADS CHOICE AWARDS, EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD****This will definitely be a top 10 book for me this year!!I have now read all of Mr. Bachman’s books and have enjoyed them all.

This book had me engaged from the very beginning.There are a handful of characters and they are all well developed. He is a genius when it comes to portraying people, their emotions, their habits, their “quirkiness”. This book reminded me of a Seinfeld episode. There are lots of things going on involving most of the usual cast and they don’t all get tied together until the end. I knew that there were underlying connections but I didn’t really guess all of them until they were revealed. As you know from the quite extensive blurb this is “ a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined.”I took a lot of notes about things that made me laugh but to share them would ruin the surprise for you, the new reader. I have never been so amused while learning lessons about life.“Everyone inside the apartment had their own complexes, their own demons and anxieties: Roger was wounded, Anna-Lenna wanted to go home, Julia was tired, Ro was worried, Zara was in pain, and Estelle . . .well . . .no one really knew what Estelle was yet. Possibly not even Estelle”Along with the narration of the events taking place there are also pages of interviews. After the event the police are trying very hard not to personally implode as they interview the hostages who really weren’t hostages!!! Why are they being so uncooperative????This book is best gone into blind, you won’t understand how incredibly well written it is until you immerse yourself in the story.If you have read any of Mr. Bachman’s books before, BUY THIS BOOK. If you have never read any of Mr. Bachman’s books, BUY THIS BOOK. There are some serious issues dealt with along with the lighter tone of the novel including: divorce, lack of leadership, father-son relationships, betrayal by someone you love, psychological problems including thoughts of suicide.

I\\'ve never listened to an audiobook and had that serious of a yo-yo happening constantly - like there would be literal tears leaking out of my face followed by laughter. The way all of the characters came together and fed off of each other\\'s energy was amazing. The way their pasts interwove with their presents was just as stunning.

Fredrik Backman has been on my list of favorite authors since I read A Man Called Ove several years ago. I’ve have read all of his published books and I loved all of them. But when I started reading this one, I became anxious in another way. I was anxious because I thought I was going to end up not liking the book. It’s kind of a quirky story, bizarre at times. The narrator even says , “The whole thing is a complicated, unlikely story. Perhaps that’s because what we think stories are about often isn’t what they’re about at all. This for instance, might not actually be the story of a bank robbery, or an apartment viewing, or a hostage drama. Perhaps, it isn’t even a story of idiots. Perhaps this story is about a bridge.” ( From an advanced copy.)A failed bank robbery that turns into an apartment hostage situation and it felt just a bit over the top, but then, as he always does, Backman sneaks up on you and you’re laughing one minute and heartbroken the next and ultimately your heart is stolen. I’m not even going to try to relay the plot here. Fans of Backman will want to read it for themselves. I will say, though, that I definitely was not disappointed and in the end, my anxiety was unwarranted. Its moving and reflective of Backman’s astute sense of humanity. A humanity in all of its glory as these characters share their anxieties over the burdens that life doles out, and they open their hearts to each other. I was reminded of the parental love and anxiety over children that we saw in the Beartown books, of relationships between a parents and children, of relationships between husband and wives. There’s some of the same seemingly simple prose conveying something more meaningful than at first glance in this novel as in the others. The relationships that developed between strangers were perhaps the most poignant. Connections slowly unfold between characters and I felt myself slowly connecting to all of them, especially the bank robber. This felt personal and philosophical in many ways. The intimate tone reminded me of Things My Son Needs to Know about the World. I loved that Backman created these characters who made me believe at a time when I needed believing, that there just might be people who will do something even if it seems they shouldn’t, just because it’s the right thing to do.

When everything goes wrong for a bank robber, he ends up holding a group of hostages at an apartment viewing.In this character driven narrative, with its maze like twists and turns, there are surprises as we learn of the stories of these characters, each of whom are skilfully developed. When the police storm the apartment, the bank robber has disappeared, what happened? The characters are interviewed, but all to little avail. Backman\\'s storytelling is full of hope in how it zeroes in on the state of the human soul, outlining the incomparable value of kindness, understanding, humanity, forgiveness and compassion in a world of human idiocy. I found this novel to be reading of the highest order, so entertaining, with the ability to make you laugh and cry. It is a touching novel that cements Backman\\'s reputation as a terrific must read author, smart, offbeat and imaginative. I have no hesitation in recommending this highly, I have no doubt I will be returning to it, time and time again in the future.

This group of mismatched folks, each with their secret fears and mistakes, slowly open their hearts to one another, and as a result, find their lives inexplicably changed for the better.At its heart, this is a story that speaks to the humanity in all of us. No matter our backgrounds or experiences, we each have done the best we can with what we are given. We have messy feelings that go with our messy lives. We\\'ve made mistakes and all deserve second chances to redeem ourselves. That is what Backman has captured so deftly with his tale.Reading this book feels like digging through a treasure trove, with wonderful surprises at every turn. There\\'s even a little mystery in here, when the police tries to reconstruct what happened, and things don\\'t seem as straightforward as they initially thought. The mystery is really a small part of the story, but even that is superbly done and managed to surprise and delight me.Backman\\'s writing style has always been quirky and his themes somewhat sentimental, but the two elements balance each other out, so that the quirkiness cuts through the cheesiness and helps to tone it down. The theme of this story, when you think about it, is really more sentimental than all the rest, so I found the writing to be even quirkier than his other books. I really enjoyed it, but I can see how this style wouldn\\'t be for every reader or even every moment.I appreciate that Backman tries to tackle complex and timely topics in his books, and he does so in such an uplifting way. Especially now, when we live in a world more divisive than it\\'s ever been, this story reminds us that if we only take the time to get to know the other side, we\\'d realize we are more alike than we are different. In my opinion, it\\'s an overly optimistic stance, but it\\'s still healing to be able to escape into this imaginary, wonderful world, even if just for a few hours. ...more This Swedish novel is about a hapless apartment viewing, a hapless bank robbery, and a hapless hostage situation.

This story represented well our shortcomings, our disparities, our faults, our adult lives which aren\\'t so perfect.

But not ‘all’ the time. If you listen to each other ‘all’ the time, there’s a risk that you can’t forgive each other afterward”.  “And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are. Even astonishingly late in life, people seem incapable of considering that their parents might not be super- smart and really funny and immortal. Perhaps there’s a biological reason for that, that up to a certain age a child loves you unconditionally and hopelessly for one single reason: you’re theirs. Which is a pretty smart move on biology’s heart, you have to give it that”.

And I have to say, I wish I could find me a crazy, sweet group like this and be friends forever.  \"So now we all know each other! Lovely!\" Estelle declared, so delighted that she clapped her hands. And for such a slight person she could clap her hands surprisingly hard. Which isn’t a great thing to do in a room in which someone is holding a pistol, seeing as everyone thought that the sudden clap was a pistol shot and threw themselves down to the floor. The bank robber looked at the prone bodies in surprise, then, with a scratch of the head, turned to Estelle and said: \"Thanks. That was very helpful of you.\"*Then Roger looked around for something heavy to attach the note to, and eventually found a round object that seemed just the right density. That was how the police came to hear someone shout from the balcony again, and when Jack looked up, a lime hit him on the forehead. From a distance, that makes one hell of a bump. Happy Reading!

During the opening pages of most books authors are tasked with endearing the reader to the character, what I’ve heard described as, “Patting the head of the dog.”The big reason this book works and is so popular is the author’s credibility, he is a wonderful talent who readers trust implicitly and are willing to give him a few pages to set up the story.

Bank robbers, they can have bad days at work, too. Hand on heart, which of us hasn’t wanted to pull a gun after talking to a twenty year old?”This book is much more broadly humorous than his other works. But he still deals with all the important issues - the anxiety a parent feels worrying about a child, the anxiety one sibling has when another goes off the rails, the anxiety of being an adult, even the anxiety a stranger has for another soul in agony. I love Backman’s way of looking at the world, his ability to express things so perfectly. “Suddenly, you find yourselves living alongside each other, not with each other.” I found myself highlighting all sorts of passages, big and small. Backman employs an unknown narrator to talk to the reader, which works really well. The narrator actually empathizes not just with the characters, but with us, because we all share the same emotions, desires and needs. There are lots of laughs here, but also crying. Keep the hankies handy. I loved the ending and the twists that Backman used. It’s especially poignant that Backman lost a friend to suicide and has suffered from panic attacks.My thanks to netgalley and Atria Books for an advance copy of this book.Update - reading this for book club and it’s equally impressive the second time around.

And I loved it enough to put it in my potential “best book of the year” category (which only has one other book in it so far). Wow, this author. Fredrik Backman sure understands the human struggle. The struggle to survive, to connect, to love, to do the right thing by others, and to just live a decent life. He could take an empty room with white-washed walls, beige carpeting, no windows, and two people and turn the scene into a Pulitzer prize-winning novel. And he does it with humor. Ridiculous humor—my kind of humor. I laughed out loud many times during this story but cried throughout the last several chapters, which served brilliantly as the epilogue. Early on I read one of his novellas. I think I gave it a two-star rating. What the hell was wrong with me then? I never reread anything, but I’m going to reread that novella and see what I think of it now. More than 2 stars worth, I’m sure. This story is chock full of fascinating characters, 12 in all, I believe. Most of them are misfits—anxious misfits, and it was so captivating to follow them through this essentially one-day story. All at the same time this book is compelling, heartfelt, inspiring, and ridiculous. I can’t write well enough to really give this novel its due. Just trust me when I say you need to read it. It will be good for your soul.Thank you Net Galley, Atria Books/Simon and Shuster, and Fredrik Backman for allowing me to read an ARC of this book.

The opening paragraph of \"Anxious Peopl MY FAVORITE BOOK OF 2020I didn\\'t want this to end so I read it a second time and some parts more than that, and I\\'m sad that it\\'s time to call time, but it is.This is a the story of a bank robber who, oops, tries to rob a cashless bank then panics, runs across the street and right into a realtor\\'s apartment viewing, panicking even more and taking everyone there hostage. The opening sentence of \"Beartown\" is one of my favorite opening sentences of all time. The opening paragraph of \"Anxious People\" is great but it\\'s the first sentence of the second paragraph that I love best (advance copy disclaimer): \"This story is about a lot of things, but mostly idiots.\" \"Anxious People\" is all about idiots, and that\\'s us -- and if you think you\\'re not an idiot, I won\\'t argue with you because you\\'re an idiot. We\\'re not idiots all the time. We\\'re not heroes all the time. We don\\'t do the right thing all the time. We do our best and some days can\\'t even manage that. \"Anxious People\" is hilarious except when it\\'s not. There\\'s a mystery and the entire book reminds me of a slide puzzle in that you think you get what\\'s happening but not until every last piece is in place can you see the entire picture. It has twists and surprises until the very end. The characters are terrific. The hostages include a very pregnant and thus cranky lesbian and her earnest spouse, one of those people who seems to always manage to say the wrong thing; a buttoned-up banker; a sweet and slightly enigmatic elderly lady and a bored older married couple whose idea of fun is going to Ikea. And the rabbit, ha. There\\'s a terrific pair of cops. And pizza. I read the entire book twice but there\\'s one part with pizza I\\'ve probably read ten times. There\\'s also a bridge which the apartment looks out on, which has been the scene of suicide and attempted suicide. And there\\'s a therapist, because for those who think they can\\'t handle things but can and those who think they can but can\\'t, those who\\'ve been affected by someone else\\'s jump and those who think about doing it, therapy can be the bridge back to the safe mainland of a mind at rest. \"Anxious People\" is funny, moving and delightful. Frederik Backman can do it all, make a hockey game the most important one of your life not just theirs, make a hostage crisis entertaining and meaningful. He\\'s clear-eyed, witty, understands human nature very well and has a generous heart. He\\'s such a gifted writer we start getting to know his characters quickly through a few lines of dialogue or a single action. With its short chapters and intervals of police interviews and therapy sessions, \"Anxious People\" moves at a quick pace. There wasn\\'t a page where I didn\\'t laugh out loud at least once and there were times I cried. I\\'m sad to move on and will end by plagiarizing the end of my review of another Backman book: Frederick Backman, you amaze.

So we learn to pretend.\"It took a while for me to `get into` this book, and somewhere in the middle, I realised (again!) that Fredrik Backman is such an incredible writer (..as I have always known - because I have read all his other books!). It feels like maybe, this book is like a test - it is surely not written for everyone - so, the initial chapters are about, and for sifting the riffraff!? This was how a bank robber failed to rob a bank but instead managed to spark a hostage drama. Life doesn\\'t always turn out the way you expect.This is a story about a bridge, and idiots, and a hostage drama, and an appointment viewing. But it`s also a love story. Several, in fact. .But, then this book is for everyone - with a message - Don`t give up on yourself and on your loved ones - there is light at the end of the tunnel. A special note to all my Goodreads friends and fellow book readers who DNF\\'d or did not like this book - - there may be a fellow human being or even a loved one whom we do not understand or may not like much, but that does not mean we leave them uncared for, right? - - please give this book another chance, because this in the true sense is what empathy is all about - \"doing everything possible, to understand the fellow human being\".\"That it`s an ache in our soul, invisible lead weights in our blood, an indescribable pressure in our chest. Our brains are lying to us, telling us we`re going to die.^^From the book:We give those we love nicknames, because love requires a word that belongs to us alone.You love each other until you can`t live without each other. And even if you stop loving each other for a little while, you can`t... you can`t live without each other.People need bureaucracy, to give them time to think before they do something stupid.If you can do something for someone in such a way that they think they managed it all on their own, then you`ve done a good job. ...more My first book by Fredrik Backman and I\\'m not really sure what to think of it!

This is a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined.Viewing an apartment normally doesn’t turn into a life-or-death situation, but this particular open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes everyone in the apartment hostage. As the pressure mounts, the eight strangers slowly begin opening up to one another and reveal long-hidden truths.As police surround the premises and television channels broadcast the hostage situation live, the tension mounts and even deeper secrets are slowly revealed. Before long, the robber must decide which is the more terrifying prospect: going out to face the police, or staying in the apartment with this group of impossible people.This book was genuinely one of the weirdest yet most endearing mix of heartbreak and comedy that I have ever read.FIrst, I have to talk about the absolute ridiculousness contained within this book. From page one, I could tell that I had to suspend my disbelief. Backman writes with a distinct voice and fills his books with humor. Although the book is mostly realistic, there are a few moments that make you tilt your head or quirk an eyebrow. You just gotta take it with a grain of salt.But somehow this book also manages to brilliantly turn on a dime to heartbreak within mere sentences.

It got to the point where I would have to skim over the first paragraph of every chapter because he was so unnecessarily wordy. It just became so incredibly grating. If you haven’t read any of Fredrik Backman’s books before, here’s my impression of the beginning of a chapter: ‘The sky is blue. Though I suppose you could call it cobalt, even indigo on some days. Occasionally azure is thrown around, but nobody is quite sure why. But if we’re nitpicking, today it was probably more of a sapphire. Although, most people are not, picky I mean, and will simply refer to the sky as blue. That’s not to say anything one way or another about these people, but is does make one wonder why that is. Why do some see the world in shades of blue, but when others look upward they merely gaze into a monochromatic abyss?Anyways, Doug drowned in the periwinkle sea.’The portions that were supposed to be emotional ended up falling flat, mostly because all of the characters were intentionally obnoxious and aggravating. My god, I have never cared less what happened to a fictional group of people. Tragic backstories were doled out one after the other to try to make you empathize with them. Each irritating member of this ensemble was also in turn revealed to be ‘like super deep and introspective, actually!’ and I couldn’t help but roll my eyes at the lame one-liner set-ups.I think the author did pull off a couple of good twists, and he’s really skilled at using the reader’s assumptions against them. But in all, I don’t think this is my kind of book. Everything’s a little too idiosyncratic, and it all wraps up a little too nicely. But if you’re looking for a vague sense of hope or whatever, I think you might still enjoy Anxious People.*Thanks to Natalie for this review copy!! 💙💙💙**For more book talk & reviews, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks! ...more another beautiful read. this one had so many quotes I wanted to write down and some really endearing characters.

Probably not, but I do think it is going to hit home with quite a few people. While this was my first book I have read by this much loved author, it certainly won\\'t be my last.The premise sounds fairly simple but yet the author created a complex tale. A bank robber holds a group of people hostage in an apartment building. After a standoff the hostages are released. Police enter the apartment but they can\\'t find the bank robber. What happened? Well, police conduct interviews with the witnesses to get answers.The author has a bit of a quirky writing style which took me a few chapters to get used to but I did grow to love it. I think a story like this could have gotten out of hand and over the top very easily but the author did a nice job staying in bounds. It wasn\\'t too much of a stretch of my imagination to believe in the characters and plot. There\\'s heart to the story which was a nice balance to the humorous parts.While some readers are big on underlining quotes or marking them to read again later in books, I rarely do it. Maybe once a month or so I find a line that sticks with me and I want to revisit it later. With this book, I have six pages in which I doggy eared the page so I could go back and read the parts that strongly resonated with me. What I find amazing about this story is there\\'s enough here in which each reader might pull something different from it. If you are asking each reader what was the message of the story the answers could vary.

This is a story that you might think you know what it is about, but often stories are not what we think they are about. This story is about a lot of things. It might seem like an unlikely story about idiots and anxious people that at times feels a little over the top but is really a story about something different. It might be a story about a bank robbery gone wrong that ends with an apartment viewing with idiots who are anxious. Maybe the bank robber is just an idiot or maybe things are just really complicated. Maybe this is a story that explores what is under the surface of what we think we see or know about someone. Maybe this is just an entertaining story or maybe under the layers is a profound story. Backman creates a diverse group of characters with their differences and slowly reveals the differences and motivations of the characters with each chapter. He explores the kind of truths people hide, the true stories about themselves and he shows us with a little compassion and kindness people slowly start to reveal those truths. Maybe it\\'s a story about what it\\'s like to be human in a world full of idiots who just might be anxious people just trying to survive in a loud world. I highly recommend reading to find out for yourselves what you think this story is about. This was a Travelling Friends Group read and makes for a great group discussion. Talking about my shelves or maybe to myselfI have added this one to my diverse shelve because the characters are diverse in their differences and experiences.It is a good representation for mental health and suicide. I have added a new shelve world settings to challenge myself to read books set in different parts of the world. The story is set in Sweden.I received a copy from the publisher on NetGalley! ...more TroubledIt is a unique reading experience with Fredrik Backman, and it often takes a few chapters to appreciate a special journey is underway.

Sometimes the humour and dialogue feel unusual but once into the novel, his turn of phrase becomes entertaining and revealing of the characters. Anxious People, like the stalled elevator scenario, poses characters that are trapped in a confined location, and as they settle in for a long wait, individual stories of different influences and choices that led them to that moment are intriguingly revealed. A past where backgrounds are unknowingly crossed sets up a future that will be altered over the next few hours. Each person will be compelled to change their relationships and the direction they were travelling. I am always intrigued by the interpretations and perspectives different people can apply to the same situation. How perspectives can affect how we deal with incidents and how we harbour issues that shape how we deal with future events. Backman serves up compelling observations on human interactions and relationships with an edge of anticipation. A bank robber attempts to hold-up a cashless bank for exactly six thousand five hundred kronor. The strange behaviour and apparent naivety foster a mystery and deeper anxiety for the bank robber. Even when the bank robber runs into an apartment during a viewing with an estate agent, and holds eight people hostage, our empathy remains with the bank robber. The personal stories unfold with great fascination and sentiment, and we often wonder what the central theme of the novel is.   “The truth? It’s hardly ever as complicated as we think. We just hope it is, because then we feel smarter if we can work it out in advance. This is a story about a bridge, and idiots, and a hostage drama and an apartment viewing. But it’s also a love story. Several, in fact.”   When all hostages are released, the police storm the apartment, but by then it is empty. The mystery is widened when the perspective of two detectives, father and son, Jim and Jack, are introduced and periodically told through their eyes. Each with their own private circumstances and motives that influence how they react.There is a wonderful wordplay around the fact that this story is based in Sweden and the reference made to Stockholmers – a term formally used to name people from Stockholm, a derogatory term of idiots used by many Swedes outside Stockholm and very aptly a term used in association with a particular Syndrome. It is more than just a word; it is an expression more than it is a place.Fredrik Backman has his own unique style and if variety appeals to you then slotting in a Backman book every now and again is a wonderful experience. He delivers the novel in an enthralling storytelling manner where he often talks directly to the reader and weaves humour with heartbreak.I would highly recommend this book and I would like to thank Penguin Michael Joseph UK and NetGalley for providing me with a free ARC in return for an honest review. ...more I believe we’re all more than familiar with the overused but much loved quote,” Live...Laugh...Love.”But those three simple words fit like a glove, perfectly describing this book!A group of strangers thrust together in a most peculiar, desperate of situations.

There is something magical about Backman’s book that I can’t explain. They just work so well for me and give me a huge dose of serotonin.The synopsis is weird. I don’t know how to explain the story because during the story itself, the story will tell you it is a story about a bridge, but also about a rabbit. It is a story about a bank robber but it is also a story about a bunch of strangers. What I can tell you is that it is a story about humans, more like a human study as much as Backman’s other books are. I love how Backman always focuses on a group of people rather than one character and it is no different here. Initially we seem to have different pieces of a puzzle and as we progress everything falls into place until we have a beautiful final result.I love the writing because it is a mix of humor with life experience without being preachy. It is very light while kind of discuss heavy topics so the mix is very efficient. There sometimes seem to be some spoon feeding which we could have done without as readers but it is something minor and did not affect my enjoyment or love of the story. From the first few pages I stumbled upon this quote and I knew I am gonna like the book:   “Sometimes it hurts, it really hurts, for no other reason than the fact that our skin doesn’t feel like it’s ours. Sometimes we panic, because the bills need paying and we have to be grown-up and we don’t know how, because it’s so horribly, desperately easy to fail at being grown-up.”   The story began by mentioning the characters jobs and not their names and it stays like that for a short amount of time, I even expected not to have names but then we get to know all the characters back stories and names and I got to like and root for all of them. The characters are really very distinctive and quirky which is something I like very much. The characters feel real and that’s why I always get emotional when we get down to business as usual from Backman’s books. The characters are all connected one way or another and that is something I think is very real. The world is a small village and this was an example of that. This is not a romance story by the way but it has very cute romantic quotes and moments and it makes my heart melt.   “He was my echo. Everything I do is quieter now,”  Summary: I feel this is a typical Backman’s story, if you read his other stories and liked them then this will most probably work for you, if they did not then this will probably not. If you want to start somewhere with his novels then this is not a bad place to start with. It is a poignant, touching story that will take you on a scale of all different emotions! ...more Anxious People is the fifth book I\\'ve read by Fredrik Backman.

It is his newest release, which I found on NetGalley (thank you), and I would definitely encourage others to read it. Backman is one of those authors who was meant to be an author -- he has a deep understanding of human nature, knows how to build suspense and emotion, and includes so many surprises in the plot. He also ensures you have a book hangover for days after finishing his work!A bank robber who really never meant to be a bank robber ends up escaping and holding a group of people hostage in an apartment viewing. It\\'s all accidental, and the anxiety we see covers a cast of about ten main characters, each who comes at the story with a very different perspective. The tale weaves in and out, revealing connections and history, all the while moving the police interviews forward. The bank robber was never found. None of the hostages are talking about what happened in the end. And the two policemen seem to be at odds over who was responsible for which piece of the investigation. Something is definitely going on below the surface.When I began reading, it wasn\\'t an immediate love. I found it choppy and meandering without enough clarity for me to latch on to. I later realized that was intentional and necessary. I should\\'ve known better in the beginning, as I was hesitating to read it the second day. While I adored three of his past books, one wasn\\'t a good match, so I worried this was gonna end up that same way. Trust me, hang on... while there are a few sections that you can tell were intentionally confusing (not the best tool for an author to choose, but one that can work well in limited quantities), for the most part, it\\'s very straightforward. It\\'s just a matter of reading between the lines and figuring out what isn\\'t being said.Imagine you are held hostage. The gun appears fake. The bank robber\\'s story is an emotional one. You\\'ve got your own issues to deal with. They\\'re all neurotic in their own ways... would you let the bank robber get away with it? No harm was done, other than the fear you might be hurt. But based on the way the events unfold, there really wasn\\'t any danger, it seemed... so... maybe you might say \"Let the bank robber go\" if things turned out the same way for you. I don\\'t know... I\\'m pretty big on people being held accountable for their actions. Not only did the bank robber try to rob a bank, fail, and then escape, but the bank robber also waved a gun at 7 or 8 people in an apartment viewing down the block and basically held them hostage. So that\\'s two bad things, which means it\\'s really a bit of an innate thing. That said, it was all for the same reason, and potentially a good one, but still.... I ramble. Backman does that to you.My biggest concern was the way many of the other people handled the situation. All a little contrived to some degree, but still entertaining and quite real in many aspects. I considered pushing up to a 4.5, but there were too many plot items that just didn\\'t add up enough for me. So... I still say it\\'s a must-read but you have to let go of your own anxieties and expectations and recognize this is more about people\\'s neuroses and reactions, not whether this could\\'ve legitimately happened. When I do that, it\\'s an easy 5 stars because Backman captures people\\'s true nature better than no other author I know. ...more It is rare that I DNF a book...and even more rare that I don’t give it a rating.

A writer who makes me laugh about the everyday things in life.To really enjoy this novel, readers may have to overlook things that seem unlikely.Some parts felt like they were written specifically for me. I am an anxious person and I\\'m occasionally an idiot who is just trying to get their chaos under control too.“Those of us who aren’t twenty can probably agree that most twenty-year-olds are wrong so often that most of them would have just a one in four chance of answering a yes or no question correctly.”\\xa0My twenty-year-old daughter didn’t find that quote as hilarious as I did…Thought-provoking and intelligent with some excellent twists. A story about connections. A story about how one life affects another in a single moment. I frequently found myself laughing out loud and also got choked up a time or two (or five). It also has many unforgettable characters.QUOTES:Parenting --- “You’re always judged by your worst moments. You can do a million things right, but if you do one single thing wrong you’re forever that parent who was checking his phone in the park when your child was hit in the head by a swing.”Being an adult --- “The terrible thing about becoming an adult is being forced to realize that absolutely nobody cares about us, we have to deal with everything ourselves now, find out how the whole world works. Work and pay bills, use dental floss and get to meetings on time, stand in line and fill out forms, come to grips with cables and put furniture together, change tires on the car and charge the phone and switch the coffee machine off and not forget to sign the kids up for swimming classes.”I’m thrilled that there are books from this author that I haven’t yet read.

When I first read most famous title  A Man Called Ove, I could tell there was something special to his work. And from there I think his books have only gotten better. He connects with readers through his poignant and reflective writing style that often muses on larger themes like the meaning of life, human connection, and love through the specific and often quirky stories of his characters. That definitely can be said of this novel as well.Anxious People tells the story of a bank robbery gone wrong. It ends up turning into a hostage situation in an apartment complex across from the bank, and the story picks up as we zoom in and out of the apartment into the lives of each of the characters involved. There\\'s our bank robber, a few couples, one or two single individuals, and the cops that are handling (or attempting to handle) the situation. As with all of Backman\\'s books, there is more than meets the eye in each of their lives and fate has a way of bringing together strangers in unlikely ways.My biggest problem with this book was the pacing. The first 100 pages or so are quite redundant. Every time we are introduced to a new character, the exposition felt the same as the previous one. And in between these character intros are interludes that bring us back to the present day hostage situation. There are also transcriptions of dialogues between the characters and the police as they are interviewing them that read quickly but lack depth. On top of that, some of the dialogue and the way people treat each other seemed too far fetched for me (even for a Backman book, this heightened drama seemed less relatable and significant than some of his other books). Perhaps some of these issues will be edited out by the time the book hits the shelves in a month or so (though I have no idea if that will be the case).Regarding the characters, I enjoyed reading about them but felt much more like an observer than a participant. With Backman\\'s other books, especially his duology  Beartown and  Us Against Them, you can\\'t help but feel invested in the lives of the characters, as if you are part of this small community. Here we see things on such a limited scope, and then are told, rather than shown, everything we need to know about the characters\\' backstories, that the usual connection I feel to Backman\\'s work was lacking.Of course there are some great quotes to pull from this book about life and love and treating each other with kindness. That\\'s to be expected from Backman at this point, and he delivers. But sadly that wasn\\'t enough to really push this book up the list for me in terms of favorite Backman novels. I\\'m sure avid fans will still enjoy this one—and based on other early reviews for the U.S. edition and older reviews of the original Swedish version, my opinion seems to be an outlier. So take all of that with a grain of salt, and if you are interested in the story based on the premise alone, you will likely enjoy this one. If it\\'s your first introduction to Backman, however, might I recommend diving into his backlist first as there is so much goodness and warmth to be discovered through his stories. This one, ultimately, fell a bit flat. ...more 4 starsHow could a sad story with a serious heavy topic makes me feel so lighthearted?This book voiced all of my fears in the most beautiful relatable way.

I mean, these things happen and factor in the book but in the end, this is a book about connections, how desperate we are to be seen by others, and how even those who are supposed to help us in our time of need are sometimes in need of rescue as well. Anxious People  tells a story—many stories, really—in a very roundabout way. It travels from past to present, focusing on many different people, and their stories are juxtaposed with interviews between the police and the hostages. I felt as if the interviews were supposed to provide comic relief, but they were almost too outrageous and annoying that they frustrated me more than amused me.There are a lot of characters and situations to keep straight, and Backman throws lots of twists and turns into the story. I\\'ll admit I had to go back and read some incidents again to make sure I was clear on what actually happened. But there is a lot of emotion here, too, and I think when Backman writes about the emotional connections we have—with loved ones, friends, strangers—and how they enrich and affect us in ways we might never know, he\\'s found his sweet spot.I love the way Backman tells a story. (Two of his books,  Beartown  and  Us Against You , are among my favorite books from the last decade.) Even though this one didn’t completely click for me, my love of his writing won out.

Fleeing, but only after being mocked by the twenty-year old bank employee, because at that point running out of the bank seemed the only option to preserve one’s dignity – if any dignity remains at this point – the bank robber who did not actually rob anything ends up fleeing into a building, running up a flight upstairs and into an open viewing for an apartment up for sale, which is occupied by seven people. Well, eight once the bank robber arrives. An older couple who spend their time renovating / flipping homes for profit, as well as something to do together in their retirement years. Two women, a couple who are expecting their baby to be born at any moment, and seem to bicker just for the sake of … bickering. A woman, whose only interest in the apartment seems to be the distant view from the balcony, a view of the bridge. Another woman, one who has lived a long life and seems lost and somewhat alone even within this group of people. Oh, yes, and a rabbit – or a man partially dressed as a rabbit, anyway, as part of a ploy to dissuade potential buyers from wanting to buy this apartment. Eventually, there will be two policemen, a father and his son, who will wander into this story, a story that may change them, as well. Inside this story that is filled with many comic moments, some of Backman’s wonderfully wry wisdom seeps in, a perception of what makes people do the things they do, as well as what sometimes breaks them. Sometimes it’s a cycle that repeats, and occasionally someone reaches out a helping hand, and that’s all that is needed to let them know that they matter, that their heartbreaks and their happiness matter. To know that someone is listening, and actually hears is a powerful weapon against the kind of pain that leads to destruction, that just leads to more pain.Backman, once again, has taken seemingly unrelated puzzle pieces of human beings and put them together a little at a time until the full picture slowly takes shape. As always, a puzzle is an ever evolving picture until the last pieces are strategically, correctly placed, and you view the finished work of art and smile, knowing Backman is a master of his craft and has never let you down.

Without making it feel heavy to read.— overall thoughts: 4.5 —⇢ trigger warnings// (view spoiler)[attempted suicide, hostage situations  (hide spoiler)] “it\\'s so hard to think of the words when all you really wanna say is, I can tell you\\'re hurting.” That main timeline happens because of a hostage situation during an apartment viewing and even though that in itself might not sound appealing to most, that\\'s really all I think you should know. Is it basically stockholm syndrome? I don\\'t know, read to find out. The themes and discussions were really the selling point of the whole book, and how it was masterfully integrated into the plot.Incredibly humorous because god forbid that there be another perspective buyer (if you read it, you know). I love that there is something here for everyone. For anxious people and those that think that they aren\\'t. “most people are just looking for something to cling to, something to fight for.” It truly is incredibly well-written with absurdity that makes sense. If this was a movie, it would be a comfort movie that I would rewatch again and again. Because sometimes we don\\'t need a strong male and female lead to go off on an adventure across an unnamed land, we just need a couple of friends to eat pizza with in an apartment looking over a bridge while watching some fireworks.I was pleasantly surprised at the details of how each respective characters were acting that went into the apartment plot, it was all entirely believable. The characters were charming not because they were perfect and saying all the right things, but because of how they reflected sets of people that you might actually find (at an actual apartment viewing for one thing but also) in your own life. In some way, you get to know the characters in a way that they just grow on you. I also love the way the characters were connected behind the scenes of the hostage taking and we kind of knew it before they did.It has a simple plot written with intricate details that made it that much more endearing and cozy. This story was really about so many different things that it\\'s hard to breakdown properly but I felt extremely satisfied with my reading journey. There are even short chapters for those of you that enjoy those. “What we think a story is about, isn’t what they are about at all.” And that’s why it was exactly my kind of story.My favorite aspect of the mystery was how it didn’t leave us until the last 20% of the story for the big plot twist and instead misleads us at the beginning of almost every chapter but tying it back at the end of the same chapter. It was just absolutely brilliant. It kept the pacing going and the reading experience exciting. I finished this within 24 hours.I somewhat saw the biggest twist coming but I didn\\'t know exactly how it would turn out. And all the other mini plot twists blew my mind. The way everything connected and came together was so well executed that it brought happy tears to my eyes for once.↣ Read this when you\\xa0need someone, or perhaps when you\\'re a little sad. Actually, read it right now because we\\'re in a pandemic and we\\'re all a little sad. As the story tries to tell us, we\\'re not all that different, we\\'re all just trying the best that we can. ↢ ...more *Many thanks to Goodreads, Atria/Simon & Schuster, & Fredrik Backman for an ARC of this book!*Clever, touching, funny, and beautifully heartbreaking!This is the story of a bank robbery gone wrong.

Or...is it an apartment showing gone wrong? Either way, a mysterious would-be bank robber stumbles into a motley crew of strangers all drawn to explore an apartment with one unique attribute---a bridge is clearly and directly visible from the window. This bridge serves as both a visual cue of connection between the here and there and also holds significant meaning for several of the apartment\\'s quirky visitors. While the \\'crime\\' unfolds upstairs, police officer father-son-duo Jim and Jack begin an investigation into the identity of the perpetrator. What they find, however, is how twisted and tangled the web of our humanity actually is, and the hostages begin to realize that this situation is much less a crisis than an opportunity to truly connect with the people around them.Backman\\'s gift as an author lies in his examination and exemplification of the ordinary, the true, and the ties that bind us all. His novels always manage to walk the fine line between hilarious and improbable, while also acknowledging the wistful, sadder truths of our shared humanity. While his sense of humor might not be for everyone, I can\\'t remember the last time I\\'ve laughed so often while reading what is ostensibly a novel exploring mental health on a real and visceral level. Backman\\'s characters never feel preachy, overwrought, or artificial--they are all flawed, quirky, and REAL. This book also read like a play in my mind, and I think it could be highly adaptable for the stage, although narration would be essential at times to capture Backman\\'s spirit. He manages the keep the identity of the bank robber a mystery for almost the entire book, but there is so much more to unpack here, that is hardly the point. I think that decision in and of itself was a clever device meant to get the reader to stop focusing on the who, what, where, and how, and really explore what lies between the lines.Backman once again feels like the wise friend I wish I had, teaching, exploring, and noticing everything about the world. I absolutely love his style, his writing, and this book will stick with me for some time. I already miss these characters, and Anxious People delivers the sort of hopeful, beautiful, and poignant message our world really needs right now. 4.5 ⭐️ ...more Anxious People by Fredrik Backman was a breath of fresh air, it was funny, interesting, meaningful and wonderfully paced.

I really enjoyed this book about a Bank Robber who isn’t really that good at bank robbing and ends up taking a group of strangers hostage. To say anymore would be to commit a gross act of spoilage.The humour, as all good funny stuff should be, came when unexpected and was genuinely funny, not laugh out loud funny, but amusing. Chuckle-worthy.The author makes the point we, us punters, are a bunch of ‘idiots’ making our way through this world. We are all negotiating our dramas (big and small) and mostly seem to make it to the end of the day. This is our common thread – the thing that binds us. We walk past each other in the shopping mall, sit next to each other at the traffic lights and are blissfully unaware of the similar difficulties our fellow humans are experiencing. I must say though, whenever I fly into a city, I always look at the rooves of the houses I fly over and reflect on what may be happening in each of those little boxes – good and bad. Sometimes, we need an event to throw us into the company of strangers, to learn about the lives of others. This story really makes one realise how we all seem to just keep going (mostly) no matter what is thrown at us, or when it’s thrown at us and in whatever quantity. It really is quite sobering. The author covers all of this with a wonderful splash of funny stuff.A really enjoyable read.Also – it’s Christmas Day here in Australia at this moment. I’d like to wish you all a Merry Christmas – this GR community is a wonderful thing and I feel really privileged to have become acquainted with quite a few of you.

The hostages are eventually released after inevitably had pizza delivered - as that happens at every hostage situation, right? The police storm in, find blood but no robber. All the hostages are interviewed by police officers Jim and Jack a father and son, who are among others, anxious people. I love Bachman’s digressions which frequently aren’t, but it’s funny and is typical of how a mind flits from subject to subject. Well, mine does anyway! There are so many acutely pertinent and acutely observed statements about people, society, Stockholm (!) and Stockholmers, age gaps and social media among others. The writing is funny, emotional, heart breaking, heart warming, and moving in equal measure. The characters are fantastic, I especially like Estelle, the oldest hostage at 87. She’s fab. I have a sneaking admiration for London the bank clerk, who though rude, did provide so real laugh out loud moments. She’s ballsy too! What can I say about the hostage rabbit? Well, that’s an unusual image if nothing else, especially as he was trouserless!!!! That enters the realms of rather bonkers!! The interviews between Jack/Jim and the hostages are also barking, nuts, crazy but there is a reason ......... and I like it! The story is full of connections though you don’t initially see how they can possible be connected as they seem so random. Overall, a highly entertaining read that via zany humour makes some astute observations and keeps you interested throughout.

It’s about a failed bank robbery, it’s about an apartment viewing, it’s about a hostage drama, it’s about romance.But above all else, it’s about idiots. (The author’s words, not mine.) Idiots who love, idiots who have no clue how to love. Idiots who want to die, idiots who want to live. Idiots who laugh, idiots who cry, idiots who make you laugh and make you cry. Relatable idiots, just like you and me, who are trying their best to be children, parents, partners—idiots who are trying their best to survive this day and then the next. “So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being a human is. Especially if you have other people you’re trying to be a reasonably good human being for.” I didn’t know how much I needed to laugh at the unexpected humour in this book. I didn’t know how much I needed the nuggets of wisdom carefully placed in between cheesy jokes. I didn’t know how much I needed to have a good cry to some of the quotes that hit too close to home. I didn’t know how much I needed this book to tell me, in its own special way, “Hey, I know you’re feeling a little sad right now, and that’s okay. You’re doing your best, and that’s enough. Everything is going to be fine.”All in all, Anxious People is a witty, poignant dramedy that is a love letter to love itself; and to parenthood, to childhood, to making it through this crazy phenomenon we call life with our sanity (somewhat) intact. “But when you get home this evening, when this day is over and the night takes us, allow yourself a deep breath. Because we made it through this day as well. There’ll be another one along tomorrow.” → 5 stars ...more Well, Fredrik Backman is a major-hit-wonder!

There are many different anxious characters in this book to get to know. I usually wouldn’t like so many characters in one story, but Backman has a way of writing true-to-life characters that makes it easy for the reader to follow and relate to. By the end of the book, you will be rooting for all of them!! I love how a bunch of very different people were thrown into a bad situation and the way they coped with it was to get to know and understand each other’s anxieties, in turn becoming friends. Because it’s a story about friendships, we all see a little bit of ourselves in the characters. If you are a big fan of quotes, you will have plenty to bullet journal with this one!!One of my favorite quotes in the book was “The ones that make you laugh last a lifetime.” It’s referring to people and it really spoke to me. After all, laughter is the best medicine and if we have that in our lives, our lives are full. There are quotes of life lessons scattered throughout the book making it even more special.For Backman fans, this is a no-brainer, read it!! If you are new to Backman, be prepared to read a book like none other you have ever read before. It will be one that sticks with you for a lifetime! It has made my top 10 for 2020 list!

This book was the 2020 away from it all that I have been craving. A bumbled bank robbery turns into the strangest hostage situation ever - a cast of characters one could only throw together from a pot luck table. (PS this would make a cool play!) The characters are likable, laughable, terrible and altogether - valuable because they are PEOPLE. That’s what made this novel - a look at people we would despise and some who just make us laugh or cry - emotion, feeling... but not in a touchy-feely wind-beneath-my-wings way.

I laughed throughout the book, and I\\'m pretty sure the only time I wasn\\'t laughing was when I was either on the verge of crying, or full-on weeping. That\\'s always been Backman\\'s strongest area: his ability to switch emotional gears without it feeling maudlin or cheap. My biggest complaint about his last novel, the sequel to Beartown, Us Against You, was that he kept reminding the reader that they were reading a book. He does the same thing here, but it didn\\'t bother me nearly as much. Why? Because this reads like a fable, whereas Us Against You read more like standard general fiction. Also, this book, while heavy at times, is a much lighter, joyful read. Breaking the fourth wall in a fable is acceptable to me, whereas inserting such into a book that depends on the reader\\'s ability to take it seriously isn\\'t. The twists and turns the book takes relies heavily on the characters being idiots and liars, so every time I thought I knew what was going on, I had to remind myself that we were dealing with a supremely unreliable cast. Backman nails this delivery device. In a lesser author\\'s hands it might\\'ve felt like a cheat. There\\'s a chapter in here, one of the interviews, where a character and a cop go back and forth about not being able to identify the perpetrator due to identity/gender politics. This segment was brilliant, and funny in the way only good parodies of society can be. I\\'m sure it will offend some people, because the target is the overly offended, but I found it genius. How do you describe a criminal in a world that\\'s constantly fighting over pronouns and misgendering? I\\'m someone who thinks you should call people whatever they prefer, but I still found this chapter unbearably funny, so shoot me.Backman excels in giving readers tidbits to chew on long after they\\'re done with one of his books, and there\\'s a metric ton of cud within these pages...okay, maybe that wasn\\'t the best metaphor lol...but I think you catch my drift. In summation: I\\'ve given Backman everything from one to five stars, so I hope you\\'ll trust me when I say this is easily his best book. Yes, even over Beartown, which I loved with a passion. If I wasn\\'t cackling, I was crying, and it\\'s rare a book gets either reaction out of me, much less both. My highest possible recommendation.Final Judgment: Life by the slice.  ...more This book is absolutely amazing!A must read! “Deep down, in memories that we might prefer to suppress even from ourselves, a lot of us know that the difference between us and that man on the bridge is smaller than we might wish.”This book gives me chills just thinking about it, it’s THAT relatable. My mind is blown. I can’t even explain how my heart is both so empty and so full all at the same time. This could potentially be my favorite book of 2020. Anxious People is exactly what we need to be reading in times like these; it is the epitom “Deep down, in memories that we might prefer to suppress even from ourselves, a lot of us know that the difference between us and that man on the bridge is smaller than we might wish.”This book gives me chills just thinking about it, it’s THAT relatable. My mind is blown. I can’t even explain how my heart is both so empty and so full all at the same time. This could potentially be my favorite book of 2020. Anxious People is exactly what we need to be reading in times like these; it is the epitome of what we are all going through. We are all anxious people. I have no doubt that every single person will be able to see a piece of themselves within these characters and their stories. Deep down, we all have secrets, but to whom are you willing to tell them?“Some of us never manage to get the chaos under control, so our lives simply carry on, the world spinning through space at two million miles an hour while we bounce about on its surface like so many lost socks.”This book has many characters from an 87 year old lady to a young couple who is pregnant to an older retired husband and wife, a banker and a mystery man—all who are held hostage by a bank robber who isn’t your average criminal—left in the hands of a small town father and son cop duo. But, you’ll quickly learn that this story isn’t about them per say—but rather each of their struggles at maintaining stability in life. It’s about how well they can empathize with one other no matter how different their circumstances may be. This tale is told in dual timelines, back and forth between present day via interviews at the police station and details that unravel as the event is actually happening. “...It can be impossible to tell the difference between flying and falling.”Everyone grapples with life’s decisions; which path to take. Sometimes life continues to hit you, blow after blow and you can’t possibly take any more, so you end up on a bridge, ready to end it all, or perhaps watching someone on that bridge wondering if your life is as bad as theirs. Occasionally, you may even be the bridge, holding another person up. “...Sometimes it’s easier to live with your own anxieties if you know that no one else is happy either.”Fredrik Bachman books are ALWAYS 5- star reads for me and he’s an auto-buy author despite what the book is even about. He hits you in ALL of the feels. He outdid himself with “A Man Called Ove”, but somehow I enjoyed “Britt-Marie Was Here” EVEN more! But this— THIS takes the cake ! Breathtakingly beautiful!I read this with 25 other ladies and we were ALL beyond impressed! 5 ⭐️ and beyond! ...more \\'This is a story about about a bridge, and idiots, and a hostage drama and an apartment viewing.

He\\'s written a book that is seemingly about a ridiculous situation with a bunch of difficult people but he\\'s made us laugh and made us cry and love those people with their anxieties and human flaws.The bulk of the novel takes part at an apartment viewing where two couples, a single woman, an elderly woman, a rabbit and a real estate agent accidently become hostages when a failed bank robber runs in looking for an escape route. Initially the hostages are difficult to like. The couples are anxious about being able to buy the apartment and niggling at each other, one of the single women is a lonely bank manager who doesn\\'t like people, the real estate agent is nervous about not being very good at her job and the elderly woman has her own anxieties. The rabbit isn\\'t having a good day either. They don\\'t act like good hostages either, ignoring the bank robber despite having a gun waved at them. But somehow, in his inimitable way, Mr Backman has us caring about these people and their relationships and anxieties. He is able to drill deep below the surface of each of them to expose their humanity and show us what makes each of them so special and he\\'s able to do it while having us laughing one minute at the quirky humor of it all and next with tears in our eyes over something poignant and touching.The police aren\\'t having a good day either. Father and son, Jim the old hand and Jack preferring modern methods, make up most of the small police force in their small town. They\\'re not used to bank robbers or handling hostage situations, but they can\\'t wait for detectives to come from Stockholm. Their interviews with the hostages after they are released, interspersed through the narrative, are hilarious. There was so much to love about this novel and remember afterwords - the connection with bridge, the pizza, the closet, the fireworks and the ending which was just perfect. I hope Mr Backman goes on to write many more beautiful books like this.  ...more 4 stars Anxious People is one of those books I had truly mixed feelings about.

I mention this because, as painful as those feelings are, I never once felt pain, sadness, or much negativity at all from this book until it was over. In fact it gave me joy. As much as it addresses sensitive subject matter like depression, infidelity, greed, and loneliness, it\\'s just as much a screwball comedy of errors. A feel-good dramedy about a botched bank robbery that turns into a botched hostage situation that turns into an inspiring story about resilience, connectivity, and unexpected friendship that subverts expectations on every page. For such emotional, hard-hitting topics, it never reaches a place that hits quite hard enough or dives as deeply as the subject matter deserves. I wouldn\\'t go so far as to say that it doesn\\'t take depression, anxiety or suicide seriously, and definitely not that it idealizes them, but it all ends a little too tidily and sweetly without prompting the emotional catharsis I feel was missing. For that reason I can\\'t quite bring myself to award it five stars, despite the intelligence, grace and cleverness of Backman\\'s delivery and Neil Smith\\'s English translation.Posted in Mr. Philip\\'s Library ...more is this book my biography?

He ran, trying to escape what his folly had caused and when he raced to the top of a staircase (where is he likely to escape from there?) and charged through an open door, the room was filled with people viewing the apartment with a real estate person. Suddenly they were hostages, and the bank robber was in even more trouble. As the robber/hostage taker tried to work out what to do next, the people – including an elderly couple and a pregnant lady – began talking and arguing with each other; getting to know one another.Two police officers – Jack and Jim – were in charge. Jack was the son of Jim, and while they shouldn’t have been working together (it was obvious why when reading the story) they tried. As the hostage crisis moved forward, the building surrounded by police and journalists and a negotiator on the phone – hours away and stuck in traffic, the hostages were hungry. After pizza was delivered and everyone was satisfied, the bank robber/hostage taker knew he would let the hostages go. What would be the outcome for him? Anxious People by Fredrik Backman is filled with anxious and uncertain people; of people who’ve made mistakes and people who try to amend those mistakes. There are also people who are kind and empathetic, who do their best for people whether they know them or not. I enjoyed the “actual story” which was poignant and moving - and showed us the meaning of the bridge... But, while many others have laughed out loud at this book, my sense of humour doesn’t seem to fit with Fredrik Backman books. For those who are Backman fans, go for it – you’ll love it!

There are two married couples and the rest are singles. What they have in common is that they are all anxious and obnoxious and are strangers to each other. There is also a bank robber who is there by pure happenstance. At this moment in time they are being held hostage by the bank robber, which only making our characters even more anxious and obnoxious that usual. But, unknown to them, there is a common thread that binds these people together. That thread being a bridge. Apart from the people in the apartment there are the father and son team who arrive as the police presence.Just when you are thinking that you can’t stand another moment with these horrible, horrible people their stories start to emerge and suddenly it’s a case of what you see is not always what you get. Before long you will find yourself laughing and crying along with everyone else.What Fredrik Backman is, is a spectator of life and his gift is to put on paper what he sees in such a way that is entertaining and at the same time uplifting. No matter how bad the situation, to quote Monty Python “always look an the bright side of life”And this Fredrik Backman does with consummate ease.Can’t recommend it highly enough.5 stars  ...more Holy fuck.

He writes in a manner that gives the impression he is speaking to the individual reader. It is witty, cleverly constructed, thought-provoking, poignant, tear-jerking and wildly humorous. It begins with a desperate first- time bank robber who is having a very bad day. In the midst of a divorce, in dread of losing the custody of the children, jobless, and on the verge of eviction from their apartment, robbing a bank seemed the only solution. Later, described as the worst bank robber ever\\', the attempt to rob a bank fails spectacularly. The would-be robber entered a cashless bank and the police are called. Fleeing, the robber takes refuge in an apartment being shown to prospective buyers and people who just go to real estate showings out of boredom.  The mask-wearing robber is waving a gun, and ends up with eight hostages who are described as the \\'worst hostages ever\\'. There are two married couples among the hostages. There is an older married couple who are retired, but now buy apartments to renovate and resell. A young couple consisting of a pregnant woman and her wife. Both couples are squabbling constantly. and have doubts about their relationships. A wealthy lady in her 50s attends apartment showings as a hobby to see how the working-class lives. There is a kindly woman, close to age 90, and of course, the real estate agent is now hostage as well. A man dressed only in his underwear and wearing a rabbit head mask is not out of place in this disparate group. A father and son, Jim and Jack, are the police officers assigned to the hostage case until the expert negotiator arrives from Stockholm. They seldom agree on their different approach to police work, but Jim wants his son to solve the case before help arrives from Stockholm. The expert from Stockholm is delayed which leaves the case up to Jim and Jack. The hostages are released after receiving a pizza delivery, and a gunshot is heard. On entering the apartment they find blood, but the robber/ hostage-taker is gone. Jim and Jack are concerned that he might be wounded and might die before he is apprehended, but how did he escape without being noticed?  As the policemen interview the individual hostages, they hear a lot of sarcasm and rambling comments but receive no help in finding the criminal or learning exactly what happened. They feel there is something they are not being told, or perhaps one of the hostages helped the robber escape. There are many twists and turns I never anticipated but everything falls into place by the end. The story is ultimately about love, compassion, kindness, forgiveness, redemption and being the best person one can possibly be. It is about the connectedness that inspires people to discover their best selves. ...more 5 Character StarsThis book should have won Goodreads Choice Awards for Best Fiction in 2020.

The novel was heartwarming, charming, witty and heartbreaking. I felt a million emotions reading this. What touched me the most was that a group of individuals were brought together and ultimately found comfort in each other without even knowing they needed it. I found that so beautiful.I loved the simplicity of the novel and the flawed and complex characters. Backman really knows how to write real and genuine characters. They were so vibrant and jumped off the page. He is also great at describing the feelings of loneliness, anxiety and hope unlike any other. Those feelings felt so tangible that I had to put down the book for a bit to absorb his words, because wow someone finally put those feelings into words!This book tugged at my heartstrings. I loved every single character in this book. They may be idiots, but they’re my idiots. I am looking forward to reading more of Backman’s works! ...more This book made me feel good, which is no small accomplishment given my level of election/virus anxiety. I loved every single character and I can’t say enough about Marin Ireland’s excellent narration of the audiobook. She had to bring so many characters to life and she did it brilliantly. An absolutely hilarious novel about serious things.Well, it’s Backman, right? However, this is different. While some topics like anxiety, suicide, marriage, death, parenthood etc. are very real – and there are some in-depth observations one is used to from this author – overall this is a very unlikely story.

It’s not as grounded in reality as some of his other novels. It’s pretty absurd sometimes. Often in a good way.The beginning isn’t great, I have to say. Backman occasionally was almost too cynical for my liking. And also too meta. I wasn’t sure that kind of narration was going to work for me. The third-person narrator is too present, almost becomes a character himself. While I asked myself the question, is this how Fredrik Backman sees the world? It becomes distracting. However, when all the main characters are gathered in and around the apartment, the story about a bank robbery gone wrong (and turned hostage situation at an apartment viewing) comes to the forefront. With the narrator now only being the narrator the book reached another level. The middle part was comic genius.The characters are once again special. And they are idiots. But like the author himself says, “it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.” We’ll learn throughout the course of this story what makes life so idiotically difficult for these people. They all grew on me, as soon as I managed to understand them and their journey.Turns out Backman still believes in the good in people, and maybe I’m the one being too cynical. I needed some time to reflect, to be able to accept the ending for what it was. The appropriate conclusion to an unlikely story. This would potentially make one of the best Hollywood movies in years. Especially for the holiday season. But someone decided to turn this into a TV series. Idiots.Is this book on the same level as Backman’s best? I don’t think so. But like another reviewer once said about Philip K. Dick, the Pizza Rule applies to him; i.e. just as even bad pizza is still pretty good, bad Backman is still pretty good as well. And this is not bad at all.4.25 starsThis has been a buddy read with Alla, who really really really liked this book. (Yes, three reallys).*********Pre-review musings:Fredrik Backman is a special guy.

I gave this one a try because it sounded really different for him, but it didn\\'t work for me.First of all, there are a lot of characters in this novel, and each of them have a very sad life story. There was literally nothing positive in any of their lives. You get lots of little glimpses into the backstory of each character but nothing too deep. Just enough to let you know how miserable they are. Every few chapters, there is a transcript from the police interview of a different character, yet each interview was rambling and each character avoided answering any of the questions so that what actually happened never really comes to light and no one seems worried or upset in any way by being held hostage at gun point. It just felt like reading nonsense. The writing itself is too silly, too jaunty, to full of whimsy and didn\\'t match the depressing nature of each character\\'s life. It felt like it was inappropriately making light of the character\\'s struggle, like telling a joke \"too soon\" after an accident and it just isn\\'t funny. And the third-person point of view made the whole thing unenjoyable to read, in my opinion. I don\\'t usually write reviews this negative but a ridiculously large amount of people rave about this author that I am not worried my review will hurt this book in any way, rather I am hoping to reach a few outliers like myself who just don\\'t see the appeal in this writer who has always come across as trying too hard in my opinion. ...more Fun, Funny, Quirky and Sad!This novel had my head spinning in such a wonderful way!One really bad idea can ruin a person\\'s life!

Of course, I had high expectations going into this one given the reputation of the author — well, after I finished reading, my first reaction was: Wow! Now I know why Backman is such a beloved author to so many (my second reaction was: I need to go back and read all his previous books, like asap!). This book was so unlike anything I’ve read before. On the one hand, this was a sad story where each character had at least one (in some cases more) issue they were trying to deal with -- issues “serious” enough so as to make their lives seem utterly miserable and hopeless: be it a painful memory from their past that they were trying to suppress, worries over an uncertain future after entering a new stage in life, fear of losing loved ones due to circumstances beyond one’s control, feeling helpless in the face of life’s many injustices, etc. There were also some “heavy” topics explored in the story, such as death, suicide, divorce, betrayal, emotional and psychological distress, etc. But yet, this was not a “heavy” read at all – in fact, truth be told, this was actually one of the funniest books I’ve ever read! Yes, I know it sounds odd – after all, how can a story be so sad and heartrending one minute, to the point that I’m tearing up, yet so witty and hilarious the next minute that I found myself laughing until my insides hurt? Therein lies the brilliance in the way Backman crafted the story – the topics were heavy, yet the light-hearted tone in which this was written didn’t diminish the issues in any way...in fact, it did the opposite in that it actually made me pay more attention to the circumstances that caused the characters to be in the predicaments they ended up in.  Speaking of the characters, they were another reason why I loved this book so much. All the characters were so brilliantly written – every behavior, emotion, quirk, personality flaw, etc was so spot-on! Also, each character had distinctive personalities, yet their experiences and behaviors were so relatable and resonant on a personal level that with every single character, I actually found something in common either with myself or with someone in my life (in fact, I was nodding my head so often when I came across some familiar trait / habit / circumstance with the characters that I ended up with a neck cramp after I finished reading, lol). If I had to sum up this book, I would say that, in essence, this is an ingeniously-told, character-driven story that, at its heart, explores the trials and tribulations of what it means to be human.  Another thing I loved about this book was its cleverness in terms of structure. On the surface, it sounded like a really simple story – so simple in fact that, after the first 10 pages or so, I thought for sure the story was over, as what else was there to tell? A lot, it turned out! The “simple” story turned into multiple seemingly unrelated threads, with various tidbits of information added here and there as the story progressed that seemed to alter the narrative slightly -- just when I thought I had things figured out, well, it turns out I had nothing figured out at all! The way all the variant threads came together so perfectly and flawlessly at the end, I only have FIVE WORDS* to describe my reaction: Fredrik Backman is a genius! (*inside joke for those who read the book). If this review sounds a bit vague, note that this was done on purpose, as nothing I say (or write) about this book will be able to do it justice. You need to experience this wonderful book for yourself – and sooner rather than later! Oh and if you’re like me, who usually only skims the Acknowledgements section after finishing the book, you may want to actually read this one, as it was as much fun as reading the book itself!

About a bank robbery gone wrong as the robber unknowingly tries to rob a cashless bank. A hostage situation ensues. The story continues. The first few chapters annoyed me. In fact, the first quarter of the book. It all seemed over the top. The heavy irony grated. Even the inter-City rivalry (Stockholm v wherever this was set) was annoying. The continual calling of people “idiots” got on my nerves. It was becoming my “wordworm” (which has happened to me with another book). It was like the word \"idiot!” jumped at me off the page, madly waving its arms to get my attention. I enjoy a good bit of sarcasm, but I was annoyed. I felt like Basil Fawlty being inconvenienced by his guests.I was even more disappointed as I adored A Man Called Ove. That book held my heart, shook it up and turned it inside out. I cried buckets. I fell completely and utterly in love with it. Which is why I couldn’t understand my lack of simpatico with this book.There’s a story about a bridge, and what happens on it. We’re told to not think about it.At this point, it was looking like 2.5⭐. If I managed to finish reading it.I persevered. I had to. This is the first Bookclub pick for the year, and our Bookclub pretty much fell by the wayside last year. So I settled in for the arvo, made a cuppa, stopped gazing at clouds, grit my teeth and kept reading. Finally at chapter 24 (yes, it did take that long), kerching! I started to enjoy it. It began to make sense. It wasn’t as annoying. I started to appreciate the heavy irony and farce, all thanks to the character of Zara. A bank manager, she was seeing a psychologist at the behest of her GP, who would no longer fill Zara’s script for sleeping pills, as it seems the issues causing the sleepless nights went deeper. In this chapter, Zara gives the therapist a good run for her money. Never mind the heavy burden and secret that was weighing her down, and her sarcastic exterior. She was only going for the sleeping pills. There’s a painting of a bridge on the therapist’s wall. The only piece of artwork. With a woman gazing out to the horizon. What is she thinking?Slowly the domino pieces started to fall. I began to get it. I connected the dots. The various character’s stories intersected and overlapped, and I realised that it was actually cleverly done. We get the background story of the “hostages” who are viewing a flat that the bank robber looks to hide in after the botched robbery. Why are they viewing the flat the day before New Year’s Eve, when the rest of the world has other, more interesting plans? Why did the bank robber only demand 6,500 kroner?Ok...now I’m at 3⭐.I’ve settled in. The overuse of irony touches a nerve here and there, but this is also the part of the book where Backman pulls out an ace, and starts the really emotional stuff that I adored in Ove. The bits that hurt you like a tiny paper cut, that shouldn’t bleed quite so much as it does.There are great lines about life, \"We lie to those we love.\" and, \"...we just do our best to get through the day, because there\\'ll be another one coming along tomorrow.\" Spot on. I agree wholeheartedly. Some really deep, highly emotional stuff.And funny observations, like \"It\\'s hardly surprising that people get confused and society is going to the dogs when it\\'s full of caffeine-free coffee, gluten-free bread, alcohol-free beer.\" had me smiling as I sipped my full strength cuppa. I started to appreciate it more and more.The flat the hostages are viewing has a direct eyeline to the bridge. The bridge that links so many of these characters lives. If only the bridge could talk, what stories it could tell.There are plenty of heavy duty themes brought to light here, all incredibly important. Suicide, substance abuse, anxiety, family relationships, co-dependency, trying to move on from the past, and doing the best you can today. Now. Making mistakes, and knowing that’s ok too. Guilt (my favourite). All wrapped up in lots of dark humour and farcical situations.”We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrow.”By the time I finished the book the next evening, I’d fallen hook, line and sinker. Yes, it\\'s amazing. Yes, it hurts. 4⭐ emotionally wrung stars. Yes, I shed quite a few tears with this one too. It was easy to identify with the foibles and hurts of most of the characters. And if anyone is planning to read this who hasn’t already, you’ll fall in love with Estelle. Especially Estelle. You’ll see what I mean when you read it.I’d love to have given this 5⭐ as so many other readers have. It probably deserves it. But for me it took too long to get to a part where I started to feel involved with the characters. And yes, I did guess what the four words were in the letter that Zara had been carrying in her handbag, unopened, for ten years. Otherwise, amazing.Please make sure you read the “Author’s Notes” at the end of the book too. They’ll have you sobbing too. Dare I suggest that Fredrik Backman is Sweden’s Matt Haig? Yes, I think he is. We need more of both of them. \"We have all of this in common, yet most of us remain strangers, we never know what we do to each other, how your life is affected by mine.\"  ...more Rounded to 4 stars.I confess that I had no idea what to expect.When I started reading this book I immediately had goosebumps because some lines were very strong and witty.I loved the writing and I thought that the structure and development of the story was brilliant.

Absurdity may rule the day, but Backman is able to provide lessons in handling all too human problems along the way. Enjoy. Light and whimsical, but too much whimsy for me. Too much over the top. I think my expectations were too high. Disappointing. I am SO done with this author. Finishing it was painful but I did.

Narrator Marin Ireland provided voice and ambience to the story. I might have enjoyed reading it as much as listening, but Ireland’s character voices were hilarious, along with her timing. When reading or listening to a story, I always keep the title in mind. I’m not sure why Backman chose the word “anxious” as an adjective for his people. Other adjectives come to mind after listening to the story, but I’m not going to put any ideas in anyone’s head.It’s a comedy of errors; it’s madcap fun; it’s heart-wrenching in human flaws; it’s an unwitting love story. It begins with a robbery at a cashless bank. The perpetrator is desperate. The perp needs money for rent while fighting a nasty divorce. After learning that there was no money at the bank, the perp stole away in an open apartment, disrupting an open house apartment viewing. Now the blundering bank robber becomes a hostage taker.“Worst hostages ever” is a recurring statement that the bank robber makes as the “hostages” behave less than frightened. The narrative goes back and forth from the hostage situation in the apartment, to the police station where the two deputies try to figure out what happened and where the perp escaped. At the police station, the younger deputy, who takes his job very seriously, can’t get reason out of the hostages. It is hilarious. One of the first to be interviewed is the lady bank teller who first came across the perp. Her name is London and she is one of my favorite characters (well the way Ireland voiced her is laugh-out-loud). The young police officer echo’s the perp’s feelings,(worst witnesses ever) as the officer tries to get information out of the hostages. It’s madcap. Slowly we learn what really happened when the perp had the “hostages” and how it all evolved in mayhem. The story is also about the characters in the hostage situation. In Backman fashion, he creates flawed, charming, and quirky characters; some have those crunchy exteriors that have soft hearts. Some are sweet and just want to do the right thing. Even the police, which turns out to be son and father, provide a character study in duty and familial love.I expect Backman to provide a “feel good” story, and he delivers. And Backman’s humor: he delivers as well. The dialogue banter is fantastic. I needed those 10 hours of laughter and light-heartedness.I highly recommend the audio! ...more Thanks to Netgalley and Atria books for an egalley in exchange for an honest review.

I was more than ready to read one of my eagerly anticipated novels of the fall.  A bank robbery. A hostage drama. A stairwell full of police officers on their way to storm the apartment. It was easy to get to this point, much easier than you think. All it took was one single really bad idea. This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiotsI don\\'t know about my fellow readers but I enjoy a story in which several flawed individuals manage to make a situation even more crazy than it originally was. No doubt Backman was amazed by what police officers Jack and Jim had to encounter during the interview of the witnesses. All I know was I couldn\\'t stop laughing. But I don\\'t want people to walk in thinking it\\'s just straight up comedy. Rather there are some fairly serious topics that Backman tackles- infidelity, suicide, mental illness etc. These are handled with the most care and as the storyline progressed I became increasingly attached to Zara, Jules and Ro, Roger and Anna-Lena, Estelle and even the rabbit ( you\\'ll see)! Fantastic unforgettable read!

Anyway, my friend knew that I hadn\\'t cared for the Ove novel, but she insisted she thought I would like this new book, so I gave it a listen. First, I have to share that \"Anxious People\" is a great audiobook, narrated by the marvelous Marin Ireland. Her different voices for the characters were simply fantastic. It\\'s been a few weeks since I finished it, and I\\'m still giggling about her performance of some of the bits in the book.There is no way to accurately describe the plot, other than to say it follows a group of characters who happen to be connected to an apartment viewing, which coincidentally is near a bank, which happened to be the place of an attempted robbery that same day. Hijinks ensue.I was a bit astonished at how cleverly the author wove together all the various plot points and characters. There was also a surprisingly thoughtful discussion of the problems with the banking and real estate systems, and their negative effects on society — none of which I was expecting but I appreciated it was there.In short, this novel was a delight, and also a pleasant distraction during an incredibly intense news cycle following the presidential election. Highly recommended if you enjoy clever comic novels that have a lot of heart. ...more This book is both sad and funny. Being human is not easy. Especially if you are an adult.

While they try to decide how to resolve the situation before \"the Stockholmer\\'s\" arrive the drama plays out on television stations live.The bank robber in this situation really isn\\'t a bad person. Rather a person who had a really bad idea. After a while when the people tell their stories and get to know each other better the bank robber lets the hostages go. But when the police storm the apartment there is no bank robber. How did the robber manage to escape?In interviews at the police station the hostages each tell their own version of what happened. What we have is a group of dysfunctional people and a locked room mystery. If you enjoyed A Man Called Ove I think you will enjoy this. A group of disparate people thrown together. It is sad.

This was an absolutely amazing read!! I’ve tried to read A Man Called Ove at least three times. I’ve never been able to finish it, and because of that I’ve unfairly written off Backman and everything else he’s written since then. Oh, I’m aware of his books.

Hot damn, I’m so glad I did! I seriously can’t remember the last time I had this much fun reading a book. Probably Then We Came to the End by Joshua Ferris. I guess I can remember. There’s probably plenty of other times, too. Man, I loved this book. Anxious People is a lot of things, and it openly admits that to you as you read through it. There is a bank robbery. There is a hostage situation. There are twists and turns. There is a lot of humor. Oh, and there are anxious people. Anxious police officers, anxious hostages, and anxious bank robbers. The book bounced around a lot, moving the story forward, revealing more details, but it also spends time unpacking all of the characters in interesting ways. It’s a pretty moving story, too. It’s not really about the robbery or hostage situation. Those things are definitely there, and there are plenty of twists along the way related to them, but the story is ultimately about the anxious people. There are so many underlineable quotes or sentences in this thing, so much that I felt like I could relate to. I don’t want to give away much, but the main themes of the book are pretty universal, and I think there is something for everyone here. It’s a lot of things at once, but this book is just a lot of fun to read. I was laughing out loud often, and I was a lot of other emotions at other times. I had a tough time stepping away from this story to do life stuff, and I highly recommend this to everyone who likes books (which includes you). If you don’t like books, I’m not sure why you’re here or on Goodreads at all. I’m now going to check out more Backman books. Here’s to second, third.

Police surrounded the building, the bank robber had to give up because there was no other choice and there was no way to escape anymore. So all the hostages were released, the police stormed the apartment but it was empty with blood on the floor, no one knew where the bank robber was and then the story begins…This is my third read by this author but the writing here is a bit different from my previous read by him!

I enjoyed this too, so much, it surprised me with the main twist, and when it was revealed I was laughing because the author tricked me so well!

Everyone has their own struggles to deal with in life and we never truly know how we will react in a situation until we are actually in it. We all see the world through our past experiences, so different people can take different things away from the exact same situation. This book also talks alot about kindness and forgiveness. It felt very wholesome, heartwarming and deep, with some humor thrown in there as well. We all need to be just a little bit more kind, understanding and forgiving of the people we encounter in our lives. This book is definitely very character based and doesn\\'t focus a lot on the plot. If you are looking for a fast paced book then this may not be the book for you. Otherwise, I absolutely recommend this book! ...more Anxious People is my second book by Backman.

Anxious People was different from anything that he had previously written in my opinion. It was brilliant and yet so quirky in both the writing and the plot. This story was most definitely character driven and even though each character was uniquely different they all found a connection with one another. Blackman was able to put the most unlikely people together and have them be rewarded with the gifts of self discovery, human compassion, forgiveness, love, friendship, coming to terms with grief, loneliness and even trauma. I was so excited to read Anxious People and I was not disappointed. As I already stated, the plot was brilliant. Who thinks to base their book on a bank robbery that took place in a cashless bank, about bridges, hostages and idiots? Fredrik Blackman was able to weave an outstanding plot around all those things. The unfortunate but desperate bank robber chose the wrong bank to rob. The amount the bank robber wanted was quite specific. It was not an enormous amount of money. The amount was just enough to pay a month\\'s rent but no matter how much or little the bank robber intended to take it was useless in a cashless bank. Faced with being caught by the police, the bank robber escaped the bank and found refuge in an apartment building across the street from the bank. The bank robber took the steps in the apartment building looking for an exit. The higher the bank robber climbed the stairs the more it became evident that there was no other way out of the building. Quite by accident, the bank robber noticed that an apartment door was open. With no apparent choice left, the bank robber entered the apartment to find that it was being viewed by potential buyers. The bank robber, still wearing a face mask and holding a gun, joined the group of perspective buyers. All of a sudden, there was a hostage situation. Could it be described as a hostage situation in the true sense of the word, though?All the characters in Anxious People were so real. I loved how they all fit together and had connections even if those connections did not come together all at once. Some of the characters were even comical like the Rabbit hostage. Some were definitely easy to relate to, and yet complex like elderly Estelle or pregnant Julia and her fiance Ro. I laughed out loud at some parts, rolled my eyes at other parts, and even cried. This was one of the best novels I have read in a long time. The human connection was what made it so real for me. The themes of suicide, metal illness and death were apparent throughout the novel and yet it wasn\\'t at all depressing. Finding hope, having someone to talk to and working through difficult situations in life is key. I would highly recommend Anxious People by Fredrik Blackman. My rating is 4.5 stars. Anxious People will be published on September 8, 2020. I received a complimentary digital version of this book from Atria Books through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

A little kid could have written a better plot than this author.  The story is all about a girl, who goes to a bank for robbery because she wanna have money to rent a house. But the bank is out of money. Then she goes to an apartment to hide from the police and makes the people hostage and then the hostages plan on helping her to get her out of this situation. Two policemen, father and son, work on this case. And one of them ends up helping the girl, too. Like, seriously? And the worst part was when they took the interview of the witnesses and their answers were so absurd. The author tried to have some humor but I didn\\'t find it funny. Every chapter was the same with a few random dialogues. Nothing made sense. ...more Wow. This is the loveliest book I’ve read in a while! I wish I read this a couple years ago (wasn’t released tho).

We meet a bank robber who is so desperate for money they went to rob a bank, only to find out it is a cashless bank. Not knowing what to do next they run towards a building and ends up at an apartment viewing with some very quirky characters who they unintentionally take hostage. No one walks into an apartment viewing the day before New Year’s Day and expect to be held hostage. Then again, why are you having an apartment viewing New Year’s Eve… but here we are. A group of mismatched people all viewing an apartment who ends up being held hostages. With the building surrounded and no where to go the Robber weighs the choices, go outside and face the consequences or stay inside and try to manage these Anxious People.I was utterly enamoured by this book. Backman KNOWS how to write convincing characters who are filled with heart who you cannot help but root for. I felt my heart warmed the entire time I was reading this book. I think the key take away message from this book is to be kind to everyone you meet because they are fighting a battle. Backman’s ability to let us see the humanity in others, to forgive others and to love others is truly heart-warming and why I will always pick up his book.

It is like a big puzzle that is gradually assembled, all coming together at the end.Backman takes serious topics and examines them through the lens of an absurd situation. It is a very unusual mix of elements, but somehow, he pulls it off. The characters are quirky, each expressing one or more insecurities. Backman uses humor to illuminate human frailties. I felt empathy for these people. I chuckled a number of times at the author’s wry observations on our society.

Then soothed and healed it. 🥰I think this is one of those books where it\\'s best to go in blind. I will say that it took me a while to get into it but once I did, I simply couldn\\'t put it down. Ultimately, it\\'s a love story. More than one story. A collection of them woven into one book. And can\\'t we all use a little extra love right now? 😘 “Your mom was right, the ones who make you laugh last a lifetime,” Estelle repeated, thinking of a British author who had written that nothing in the world is so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor.

The bank robber ends up with a motley assortment of uncooperative people, in a farcical rendition of how not to take hostages. Or who not to take hostage. The telling is purposefully confusing and a bit disjointed, moving back and forth in time, with teasers along the way. But it all comes together in the end, and the journey is strewn with little gems that are signature Backman, both the humorous and the apropos:\"No one goes to see a psychologist to talk about all the times they weren\\'t hit in the head by a swing as a child. Parents are defined by their mistakes.\"\"Not that this is in any way a defense of bank robbers, but they can have bad days at work, too. Hand on heart, which of us hasn\\'t wanted to pull a gun after talking to a twenty-year-old?\"And vintage Backman:\"There are simply some things that all normal people understand that you must never under any circumstances do. You mustn\\'t tell lies, you mustn\\'t steal, you mustn\\'t kill, and you mustn\\'t throw stones at birds. we all agree on that.Except maybe swans, because swans can actually be passive-aggressive little bastards. But apart from swans, you mustn\\'t throw stones at birds. And you mustn\\'t tell lies. Unless...well, sometimes you have to, of course, like when your children ask: \"Why does it smell like chocolate in here?.....But you must never kill people. Well, unless they\\'re Hitler. You\\'re allowed to kill Hitler.\"Backman can create a sense of someone and an indictment with a single sentence: \"...a woman called Zara. She\\'s somewhere in her fifties, and beautifully dressed in that way that people who have become financially independent on the back of other people\\'s financial dependency often are.\"Backman makes me smile, and laugh out loud, and feel all warm and fuzzy inside. And that is just what I needed after some stressful weeks of life. He may shine a light on some of the ugly parts of life, but he does it in such a way that we can stand to look, and even feel good afterwards, as though it was wrapped in invisible hope all along. ...more This book!!!

A seemingly normal open house, on the day before New Year’s Eve, is anything but ordinary when a bank robber (who had failed to rob a cash-less bank across the street) ends up holding the participants hostage. The hostages include two married couples who are vying for the apartment, an eighty-year-old woman, a man in a bunny suit and a seemingly uptight bank manager. As the police descend the bank robber must decide how far the hostage situation will go, and who, if only, of the hostages will be released. “People” is character driven, emotionally charged and poignant  (like all of Backman’s other novels)  while still managing to be downright hilarious and heartbreaking all at once. There is not an unlikable character in the bunch, and as they bond over their circumstances, each and every one reveals their vulnerabilities, and shows their human side. “People” has something for everyone, and there is at least one character that each and every reader will align with.Backman shines on a light on readers’ expectations and inner prejudices, as the bank robber is revealed to be someone completely unexpected. As only Backman can do, “People” also portrays the positive and caring side of humanity, even in dire circumstances. The short chapters make this novel easy to read and it is narrated almost completely in the third person. I was invested in each of the characters’ plot lines, and appreciated Backman’s unrealistic but completely cheerful ending.

One story after the other, one deep theme at a time, his writing has slowly climbed to the top of my list. I love how he writes nothing other than the daily life of some characters and yet weaves it into an amazing story. His characters are real, every day people, his short tales and anecdotes are just some versions of our lives, his humour has a tinge of deep sadness to it and the emotional aspect has the brightest laugh filled there. It\\'s something unlike anything I\\'ve ever read so all I have to say is, if you haven\\'t read Backman yet, do it today.  But we weren’t ready to become adults.

There’s the curmudgeon (or two) with heart of gold and the flighty young person (or two) with more sense than it seems.

You might even cry.I don’t think book is as good as some of Backman’s previous efforts (“A Man Called Ove” and “Beartown”). The concept is good: the world’s most reluctant bank robber accidentally robs a cashless bank and winds up taking a group of people at an open house hostage, and they are the worst hostages ever. It’s just a tad too much. Too much coincidence. Too much cuteness. Too many many aha! moments. I know what I’m getting into with Backman, but this book could have benefited from just a touch of realism.Overall, I enjoyed this book, some parts more than others. I think it’s worth reading, but if you’re new to Backman, pick up “A Man Called Ove” instead. ...more 2.5 starsHave you ever listened to your favourite song through distorted speakers?

No one in Fredrik Backman’s outstanding fiction work, Anxious People, is immune from idiotic moments.

Ridiculous, inane events had me chuckling early on as a would-be bank robber screwed up and wound up in an apartment full of strangers. These individuals naturally assumed they were being robbed or taken hostage. Who wouldn’t? The perpetrator held a pistol and wore a ski mask. The “robber” appeared flustered, kept apologizing, and asked for quiet and time to think.From the onset, this caper was a major screw-up. Even the policemen in charge, a father-son team named Jim and Jack, couldn’t interview the witnesses effectively and had let the perpetrator slip though their fingers right under their noses. Idiots, right?It’s a story about a bank robbery gone wrong. Right? Wrong. It’s also a story about a bridge. And about ? Huh? I can’t tell you more. There are more surprises, one after another, which on the surface do not make sense. Comical, head-scratching additions that momentarily confused me until the pieces began to connect. This is the beauty of Backman’s writing. He doesn’t lay it all out at once. Rather, he slowly adds details layer by layer.The apartment scenes are interspersed with interviews at the police station. Those are bizarre and frustrating and amusing. Then there are Zara’s therapy sessions. Her therapist appears to struggle with issues of her own, which should surprise no one. All of this adds to the brilliance of Frederik Backman.At the same time, he peels back the masks that hide the insecurities and anxieties that each person feels. Family crises. Divorces. Professional and personal identity questions. Life and death events. At an open house, these strangers become human to one another, to their spouses, and even to themselves. Jim and Jack are not excluded from instances of personal connection aside from their work either. The events of this day and the people they meet remind them that they are not just colleagues. They are father and son.To truly love this book, I feel, one cannot expect a realistic plot or even true-to-life characters. Mr. Backman goes beyond bounds of reality. That’s not to say that this is fantasy; it is not. But he does make the pieces fit just so, and wouldn’t it be nice if that could happen for all of us?I dare say we all have our moments of idiocy, of anxiety. Backman does make a case for those who truly need help, and that is important too. What touched me so much was his ability to demonstrate the power of connection between people. Listen to one another. Be kind. Pay it forward. Enjoy this book.Thank you, Fredrik Backman, for this wonderful gift.5 stars ...more QUICK TAKE: love me some Frederik Backman, and this book is phenomenal.

You\\'re supposed to have a job, and somewhere to live, and a family, and you\\'re supposed to pay taxes and have clean underwear and remember the password to your damn Wi-Fi. Some of us never manage to get the chaos under control, so our lives simply carry on, the world spinning through space at two million miles an hour while we bounce about on its surface like so many lost socks. Our hearts are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye. We\\'re not in control. So we learn to pretend, all the time, about our jobs and our marriages and our children and everything else...we just do our best to get through the day, because there\\'ll be another one coming along tomorrow.Sometimes it hurts, it really hurts, for no other reason than the fact that our skin doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s ours. Sometimes we panic, because the bills need paying and we have to be grown-up and we don\\'t know how, because it\\'s so horribly, desperately easy to fail at being grown-up.Anxious People is chock full of fantastic quotes and scenes, I could go on and on, but that would ruin your experience of reading this for yourselves. I am always so impressed with how Backman can realistically write flawed characters that we all probably know in our own lives. The people you will meet in this quirky tale are not very likable. I need a likable character to love and I was a bit worried that I wasn\\'t going to be satisfied. Backman, however, has the uncanny ability to take such unlovable people - idiots in their own ways - and make you fall in love with them. Bravo to Backman for having such a skill!There is really much to love in this seemingly strange and chaotic affair. In Backman\\'s story, he captures a reality of life for a group of disparate misfits with nothing in common on the surface and connects them with each other in ways that you\\'ll never imagine. There is a pair of bumbling, not-too-swift policemen, a retired couple who flip houses to keep their marriage interesting, a young couple panicking at becoming parents, and a wine-loving elderly opinionated woman. There is also a snobby, wealthy banker who dislikes people and a silly realtor with no sense at all. The voices Backman gives these characters are so real to life that I nodded right along reading their conversations and thoughts. I own and have read all of Backman\\'s novels now. I\\'m still amazed at how he writes what people think about and maybe don\\'t talk about and sometimes it\\'s painful. But he also can make you laugh in the next paragraph and that\\'s what makes him so good. It\\'s as if he\\'s up in our brains writing down all of our anxieties onto his pages in the words of his characters. In this story, we get the sense of all the little moments in life and how much they mean to us as individuals and collectively. It may be a story of a bank robbery turned into a hostage situation on the surface, but like the characters, there\\'s much, much more to it than you\\'ll ever imagine. Pick this up and read it. You won\\'t be disappointed!!Everyone inside the apartment had their own complexes, their own demons and anxieties.They may not have had much in common, but they all knew what it was like to make a mistake. ...more 4 starsYou can read all of my reviews at Nerd Girl Loves Books.This is another wonderful book by one of my favorite authors.

The youthful cop is disappointed. The prisoners have been delivered safely, however, the prisoner taker is missing, and the cop is sure that a few, if not all, of the prisoners, are telling not exactly every bit of relevant information. The enormous supervisors from Stockholm will before long be there to dominate. The more established cop stresses for the youngster, who clearly needs to illuminate the entire thing before they show up. In any case, the riddle is crushing him. Covered up by a ski-veil and using a gun, the looter made an ineffective endeavor to ransack the bank, at that point fled into a condo open for a survey, kidnapping the possible purchasers. After an exhaustive hunt of the loft, notwithstanding, there was no indication of the bombed burglar. The cross-examination of every one of the prisoners yields minimal valuable data. Obviously, the peruser, conscious of the burglar\\'s considerations, has it sorted out before long, isn\\'t that so? Sure. In trademark Fredrik Backman style, he gives the peruser a cast of individuals, all with their own individual tensions, yet all simple to relate to, tosses them together and bit by bit uncovers how they arrived in such a state. On the off chance that all are at first outsiders, there are certainly under six levels of partition between some of them. There\\'s a firearm, a reasonable piece of blood, a huge bunny, a bowl of limes, a few pizzas, and somebody winds up with a bump on their temple, yet no creatures are hurt in the creation of this story. Persistence with the underlying senselessness is sufficiently remunerated with a charming secret, clever perceptions and sage remarks, and heaps of laugh uncontrollably minutes: \"The burglar stepped to the floor in disappointment. \\'Nobody\\'s tuning in to me!

He can take a plot that seems like pure satire and through his character\\'s interpersonal relationship\\'s breathe pure love of humanity so that he makes a true believer out of me that his plot could happen. He writes with a philosophical style in his latest narrative. He was really able to transform me by his tender renderings of each character who treat each other in the end with so much love.I went from thinking I was not going to like this one to loving it. He writes the absurd happenings and can turn the tables of suspended belief into making me a true believer. There are not that many writer\\'s who can turn the ludicrous plot into making it seem from being preposterous into making me willing to automatically believing that he is really writing about reality and life. \"The truth? The truth about all this? The truth is that this was a story about many different things, but most of all about idiots. Because we\\'re doing the best we can, we really are. We\\'re trying to be grown-up and love each other and understand how the hell you\\'re supposed to insert USB-leads. We\\'re looking for something to cling onto, something to fight for, something to look forward to. We\\'re doing all we can to teach our children how to swim. We have all of this in common, yet most of us remain strangers, we never know what we do to each other, how your life is affected by mine. Perhaps we hurried past each other in a crowd today, and neither of us noticed, and the fibers of your coat brushed against mine for a single moment and then we were gone. I don\\'t know who you are. But when you get home this evening, when this day is over and the night takes us, allow yourself a deep breath. Because we made it through this day as well. There\\'ll be another one along tomorrow.\"I am so enchanted by Fredrik Backman\\'s writing. He has the power to make me believe that this world is a better place, especially in these difficult times. What more can you ask for when you curl up with a great novel?

I couldn\\'t put it down and read it in a day. The development of the characters creates a sense of camaraderie between the reader and the characters.\"People are idiots\" but most of the time we are just doing the best we can at the moment and we all need a purpose in life. This is the story of two police officers, a bank robber unable to rob a bank because it was cashless, who in turn runs across the street and takes a group of people hostage that are viewing an available apartment. When the hostages are released, the police officers rush into the apartment only to find blood on the floor and the bank robber missing. Where did the bank robber go? In addition to the mystery of the missing bank robber, each character is dealing with their own insecurities and anxieties. Roger\\'s ego is hurt, Ana-Lena feels guilty, Julie is angry, Ro is scared, Zara is in pain, Lennart is stuck, Estelle is lonely and the bank robber is remorseful. Jack is frustrated and Jim is mourning. While being held hostage, each person is \"wrestling with their own story.\" The people in the apartment seem a bit high strung in the beginning, but the longer they are together, the more mellow and accepting they become. All the people in the apartment need to forgive someone and the bank robber needs their forgiveness. Backman takes each character and shows how an incident in one person\\'s life may affect another\\'s in a sort of \"fortunately/unfortunately\" style. The story begins with the robbery and works backward between Jim and Jack attempting the interview the hostages with some laugh- out- loud moments, the actual hostage situation and a bit of the back story of characters examining their insecurities. In the end, Backman has masterfully interwoven all the characters\\' lives and leaves the reader rooting for the bank robber. ...more Recommended to everyone!Why is this the FIRST book I\\'ve read by Frederik Backman when it\\'s around his eighth?!

On the surface, this story is about an Open House that is interrupted by a criminal trying to flee the scene of a botched bank robbery, but there are hidden depths to each character that are slowly revealed to the reader. Even a few twists along the way. The message of - we are all fellow travelers in this thing called everyday life - stays with you. Perfect read for the year that was 2020. This book was a very emotional and yet, quick read with some passages hitting harder than others. When the man on the bridge tells Jack, \"Do you know what the worst thing about being a parent is? That you\\'re always judged by your worst moment.\" I felt that in my gut. Or, \"...your anxieties briefly brushed against mine as the fibers of our coats touch momentarily on a crowded sidewalk somewhere. We never really know what we do to each other...\" And, \"It just hurts so much at times, being human. Not understanding yourself, not liking the body you\\'re stuck in.\" Despite these somewhat heavy passages, the story flows and is a quick read. It has an uplifting message and will make me all the more thankful this holiday season. Best part? Backman knows how to write and his words carry an emotional punch without knocking you out. I will be reading ALL of his other books. ...more A bank robbery in a small town in Sweden goes wrong and an unintended hostage situation takes place across the street in an apartment having an Open House.

The interviews read like comedy routines. After the initial humor, an interesting group of people emerge. What starts as a quirky story of an ill-conceived robbery turns into a moving character study. We start to care about each of the hostages as well as the unnamed bank robber who shows extreme ineptitude by trying to rob a cashless bank.In addition to learning about the people who were held hostage, the story also focuses on a nearby bridge where ten years before, it was the scene of a tragic suicide and a near suicide. The bridge is visible from the apartment.Anxious People by Fredrik Backman is a very original book that had me laughing and crying. None of the characters are exactly who they originally appear to be. Each is in need of some type of rescue. I’m a bit late to the party reading this book as I wasn’t sure if I’d connect to the story. Turns out, it took an unusual Thanksgiving holiday to spend the day reading it and I ended up savoring this lovely book.

This was some wacky characters in a unique situation with a strange backstory. Fredrik Backman’s unique talent of writing combined with his understanding of what makes people tick – pain, love, connection, and anxiety are on full display in this book: ‘Anxious People.’The enjoyment is the story told in the form of a puzzle or perhaps a light mystery and presented as “Dinner Theater” maybe.

I feel as though the characters are on stage and I am watching them perform, but in the best possible way. Fredrick calls them all ‘idiots,’ but I believe he might mean they are just ‘average,’ people who just try to get by in life, doing the best they can. What turns out to be a comedy of errors: A viewing of an apartment for sale, on the day before New Year’s Eve, puts a small group of people into minor chaos but results in them learning more about themselves and their relationships than they have in the last ten years. Backman likes to make us think while he is telling us exactly what is going on. It is comparable to, “hiding in plain sight.” You are listening, or reading, but you are not quite sure you understand what he just told you. It will all make sense a few sentences or paragraphs later, not to worry.Our group is a mixed assortment: two couples, one older married a long time, one younger and expecting their first child; will both learn they really do love each other but show it in different ways. The single people all have a story behind too, of course. One is old and lonely, another is single, working and quite capable; yet another is getting divorced and has two young children, barely making ends meet. Our two policemen, father, and son carry some baggage too. Over the course of an exceedingly long day they all learn valuable lessons, meet interesting people, and realize the future can be bright. Now do not get the wrong idea, this is not some cozy rom-com. We start out with a bank-robber who runs into an apartment building smack into an open-house for an apartment for sale, with a roomful of people that become hostages. The bank-robber is wearing a ski-mask and wielding a pistol, so everyone pays attention. You should too, it is going to be a long day, but well-worth your time.Definitely one of Fredrik Backman’s BEST!Thank you Netgalley, Atria Books, and Fredrik Backman ...more \"...sometimes it\\'s easier to live with your own anxieties if you know that no one else is happy, either.\"This story is equal parts hilarious and heart-wrenching.

The whole thing went on for several hours, until the bank robber had to give up. There was no other choice. This is one of the novels I saved for the Holiday Season of 2020, based on my positive impressions from previous Backman stories, in particular “A Man Called Ove”.Indeed, it is that sort of story, about people coming together and working on their troubles through sharing the burden. And it is set up on New Year’s Eve, in a fictional Scandinavian small town. Backman remains true to his artistic forms of expression, already established with several bestsellers. Yet, the reading experience was more ‘miss’ than ‘hit’ for me, probably due to a case of ‘too much of a good thing’ , an emotional overload driven by relentless editorial comments, which come on every single page, from every single character, at the drop of the metaphorical hat. Back when I first met Ove, that suicidal, cantankerous old man that somehow still loves life and his neighbours, Backman’s style was fresh and endearing. After four or five novels that basically re-apply the successful formula, the magic has grown stale. I still believe Backman is a talented storyteller, capable of a beautiful turn of phrase and in general treating his characters with kindness and tenderness. Our lives are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye. But I am persuaded, after this novel and “Beartown”, that he has the subtlety of a sledgehammer, more concerned with driving his point across to the readers than with letting them decide for themselves what to think about the given situations. “I think it’s wonderful, I really do, that people are free to love whoever they like nowadays.”“I’d like to make it absolutely clear that I share that view.” Another aspect of the style that made me initially a Backman fanboy was the humour, his ability to find space for a chuckle, a word play or a comical misunderstanding in character interactions. It’s still present, albeit in a rather contrived, forced manner, just like those page-long editorial inserts and the repetitions of key phrases that serve as a signature move for the author. The whole novel has a theatrical vibe, with a staged setting and people assigned predetermined roles that cover the subjects the author wants debated. The plot in particular feels unnatural, forced and highly improbable, riddled with coincidences and secret links between characters. I believe this is deliberate, not necessarily a failure on the part of the storyteller: People need fairy tales as well, not just narrative. Given the nature of the plot, it is almost impossible to talk about it beyond the initial stage setup of a bank robbery gone wrong and of the following hostage situation that puts several ‘anxious’ people in close proximity to each other.Basically, Backman tries to rewrite one of Frank Capra’s movies about small town communities coming together over Christmas or New Year. For inspiration he goes to such sources as “Dog Day Afternoon” for the anti-establishment angle and “A Long Way Down” for the suicidal anxiety angle. (Personally, I very much prefer Nick Hornby’s type of humor and his more subtle delivery over Backman. So I actually started “Just Like You” right after finishing “Anxious People”)The project is in general successful, with Backman able to drive home both the economic distress of modern life and the alienation of people of high sensibility who are pushed to the brink of the abyss by the system. I finally gave the novel a three star rating, which I consider a positive, because I don’t want to let my own disappointment with the cringeworthy humour and the artificial setting distract potential readers from the true strengths of Backman’s storytelling. She was beautiful, I wasn’t. She could dance, I could barely move my feet. Back when we first met, the way we thought about our work was probably all we had in common. The fact that we save those we can. Will I read another book from the same author in the future? Right now, I don’t feel any urge to continue, even as I look at the already acquired sequel to ‘Beartown’ . But I find some hope in a flash of self-awareness and in the ability to make fun of his own idiosyncrasies in a repartee like this: “Do you know what, [Mr. Backman]? Maybe you could get a new job writing mottos for fortune cookies?” She smiles. I smile myself, and hope for a better year to come. ...more I loved this book.

After they receive the news that there\\'s no money they escape to an open door and it turns out to be an open house at an apartment for rent. Suddenly there is a hostage situation. Totally unprepared for the situation, the robber has now the most unusual group of hostages ever. It becomes more like a party and I laughed until tears came. There is even a man dressed up in a rabbit costume and in his underwear. Whoever would have thought of such a thing? And it being Backman, there is beautiful writing and lessons. One of the young policeman\\'s mother is a priest and she tells him, \"We do what we can to help whenever we get the chance. We save those we can. We do our best. Then we try to find a way to convince ourselves that that will just have to ...be enough. So we can live with our failures without drowning.\"  There is another bit about addicts that really hit home. \"Addicts are addicted to their drugs, and their families are addicted to hope. They cling to it.\" Man, did that ever hit home. And if that\\'s not enough beautiful writing for you there are quotes from Khalil Gibran, William Shakespeare, Charles Dickens and others to make you weep with the majesty of language.

Although this is my first Backman book, I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m going to read some of his other books since I found his writing to be astounding and captivating to its fullest, as if he was directly talking to you. However, Backman does fall into the trap of being repetitive, which felt a bit exhausting; while also dragging the storyline in an unnecessary way, such as placing most of the storyline in a single apartment. What Backman does cleverly is layer the book to avoid a singular storyline. This is seen in his exploration of various life questions such as not judging others and being kind to people as one never knows what\\'s going on in their life. Overall, I enjoyed this book though I did not find myself being that much attached to the plot or characters; however, I would definitely recommend this novel if you\\'re more of a plot-driven reader.

Afterward, I started to enjoy this convoluted tale more.In a small Swedish town, a bank robber attempts to rob a bank (but only for enough money to pay rent), but the bank is cashless and the robber gets no money. The bank robber runs across the street and stumbles into an apartment viewing. The bank robber locks the door and holds the people at the viewing hostage. Eventually, the bank robber frees the hostages. When the police enter the apartment, the bank robber has vanished into thin air.The novel starts with the hostages being interviewed by a young police officer, whose father is also his partner. The interviews are all quite difficult, and the witnesses seem like total idiots. Gradually, we learn the backstories of the bank robber, the hostages, the police officers, and also the psychologist of one of the hostages and the bank teller. These honest stories of ordinary, anxious people are the heart of the novel. Each of them asks themselves “What is love?” and “What would you be willing to do for love?”. Once the mystery of the disappeared bank robber is solved, the novel then provides the reader with the happily ever after stories of the characters.3.5-Stars rounded up to 4-Stars. ...more The truth?

It’s hardly ever as complicated as we think. We just hope it is, because then we feel smarter if we can work it out in advance.

This time the journey is entirely within a small Swedish town and involves, essentially, a bank robber, a home showing that becomes a hostage situation, and two local policemen. The tone moves back and forth from amusing to funny to laughable and to sweet and on to sad and even mournful. But it all works as these are individual people not types trotted out for the story. They all have life experience that culminates in this one day.I don’t want to give any more of a plot summary as it’s far more fun, and interesting, to read it as it develops. I recommend this for anyone who has enjoyed Backman before and for others who enjoy a somewhat haphazard group of people living out a crazy day under this wonderful author’s all-seeing and knowing gaze.

I laugh, cry, scream and tell others the wonder of Backman. They tell me I’m crazy and I tell them to pick up a book by this man and become invested. Sometimes they listen.

The author brilliantly explores each character and peals back the layers to slowly revealing his true intentions with it. Some of Backman’s prose made me so emotional that I couldn’t help but cry. The way he describes common feelings we have all felt, sadness, anxiety and loneliness is something very few can do. He’s able to describe such complex and weighted feelings into such perfect words. This is why for me this is a five star read. I recommend everyone read this book. Thank you to NetGalley for giving me a free copy.

There are over 200,000 ratings; this book has over 4 stars; and only 1% of people have given it 1 star at the time of my review, so I must be the one with the problem. Maybe if I had read the physical copy as opposed to the audio, I would have a different opinion. Hearing these characters being annoying in my ears left me feeling extremely irritated. And yes, I know this book is supposed to be about idiots, and about how even idiots are relatable because – let’s face it – we can all be a little idiotic at times, but I kind of felt like it went overboard to the point where it wasn’t even endearing or relatable. I think that because I place so much of my likeness of a book on how I felt about the characters, this one fell flat to me. The book switches between the hostage situation in the apartment with all of the characters together, to the police interrogation with each of those people individually about every other chapter. Most of the time – especially during the interviews – the characters were going around in circles and off topic which made it hard to really get to know any of them. It was like all of these people were spaced out during every piece of dialogue they had, and in turn, that made me not really care what they were saying; the author was trying to make them seem so quirky that it started to feel too animated for me. Don’t even get me started on the amount of stereotypes that these characters brought up in this novel. I can’t even get into them all, but let’s just say there were a lot, and it got old, fast.All of the characters, to me, kind of felt like they had this wall up and we were only getting a surface level of who they truly were. There were some moments where I could see the surface start to break, but it was all near the end, and by that point, I was already forcing myself to continue and didn\\'t have that same excitement as I did in the beginning. The one thing I did like about this was the message, and that message was that at the end of the day, we all have fears, struggles, and lives that have a lot more in common with a bunch of strangers than we may think. The ‘you are not alone’ thought is a nice one, but I wasn’t really a fan of the way it was executed. While I love books with an inspirational message, I don\\'t really like when a book exists solely to throw around inspirational quotes here and there with no substance in the actual story. The anticipation of an inspirational quote every few chapters that finally makes me feel something towards the book shouldn\\'t be my only motivation to keep reading the story. I\\'m not going to break up with Backman just yet, but I think we need a break. ...more 3.5 rounded up. I’m a big fan of the author, but this book wasn’t one of my favorites.

The story involves a desperate individual who lost their job, is going through a divorce, and their spouse is threatening to take their children away for sole custody. Pushed to the brink, they decide to rob a bank - for just enough money to pay their monthly rent until they can figure something out. Turns out the bank branch is cashless, and this all suddenly seems like a bad idea, so they flee to a nearby building where a local real estate agent is showing one of the apartments for sale. Bursting in on the showing, the scenario switches from a bank robbery to a hostage situation…of sorts. All of the people at the viewing are, well, anxious with their own issues, including the two police offices that are trying to figure out and diffuse the situation. As the story unfolds, the author skillfully reveals the connections between the characters, that they themselves are presently unaware of, and new connections are made that, by the end are heart warming.It was interesting to learn about the connections between the characters, and the way things are pulled together in the last few chapters are the type of storytelling I’m used to from this author. While the end was redeeming, for me, the majority of the book was kind of a comedic romp with some irritating personalities. Just an ok read. ...more This book 😭😭😭😭😭😭 I finished this on my lunch break and was bawling and literally had to just dry my tears and get back to work. 😂Fredrick Bachman is SO good and taking multiple stories and tying them together in such a meaningful way.

I just loved the main theme of “things and people are not always what we expect/what we first see of them”.

The police investigation is led by a father and son combination and they try to solve the case with the minimum of fuss.The characters are excellent and funny making this novel a very enjoyable read.

So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.” Investigator:*clears throat* Okay, let\\'s get back to the bank robber.Nastassja: The bank robber is just a victim of the bank.Investigator: But how can that be if he is the one who tried to rob the bank?Nastassja: Yes, but the bank robbed him first. “It means that the poor get poorer, the rich get richer, and the real class divide is between those who can borrow money and those who can’t. Because no matter how much money anyone earns, they still lie awake at the end of the month worrying about money. Everyone looks at what their neighbors have and wonders, ‘How can they afford that?’ because everyone is living beyond their means. So not even really rich people ever feel really rich, because in the end the only thing you can buy is a more expensive version of something you’ve already got. With borrowed money.”Investigator: This is so very confusing. You are so very confusing.Nastassja: It\\'s because we all are Anxious people in search of a life meaning. And we pretend to be adults when in truth we don\\'t really want to grow-up.Because there’s such an unbelievable amount that we’re all supposed to be able to cope with these days. You’re supposed to have a job, and somewhere to live, and a family, and you’re supposed to pay taxes and have clean underwear and remember the password to your damn Wi-Fi. Some of us never manage to get the chaos under control, so our lives simply carry on, the world spinning through space at two million miles an hour while we bounce about on its surface like so many lost socks. Our hearts are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye. We’re not in control. So we learn to pretend, all the time, about our jobs and our marriages and our children and everything else. We pretend we’re normal, that we’re reasonably well educated, that we understand “amortization levels” and “inflation rates.” That we know how sex works. In truth, we know as much about sex as we do about USB leads, and it always takes us four tries to get those little buggers in. (Wrong way round, wrong way round, wrong way round, there! In!) We pretend to be good parents when all we really do is provide our kids with food and clothing and tell them off when they put chewing gum they find on the ground in their mouths. We tried keeping tropical fish once and they all died. And we really don’t know more about children than tropical fish, so the responsibility frightens the life out of us each morning. We don’t have a plan, we just do our best to get through the day, because there’ll be another one coming along tomorrow.Investigator: I do.Nastassja: That\\'s because you are an idio--*The sentence is interrupted by the sound of fireworks outside*Nastassja: You know what, detective?

I have to be honest, this book has sat on my bookshelf for a while. I recently read some really positive reviews and thought “why not?” I could use a little break from the lengthy fantasy books I’ve been reading. Anxious People did not disappoint. I was hooked halfway through the first page. This majority of this book takes place on a single day after a failed bank robbery turns into an accidental hostage situation. If you enjoy books where a cast of unlikely characters come together and bond, this is your book. The underlying plot of the book revolves around this hostage situation, but Backman does an excellent job of showing you one thing to distract you from what’s really going on. He layers in flashbacks from each of the characters’ lives that builds an interconnected timeline of events.Backman’s writing transitions from witty and blunt commentary that truly had me laughing out loud—the interview scenes are honestly comedic gold:“Jim did his best to act like he definitely had experience seeing as dads like teaching their sons things, because the moment we can no longer do that is when they stop being our responsibility and we become theirs.”At other points he uses a sort of roundabout analysis to draw the reader from one conclusion to another, it is very much like my philosophy 101 class in college where your brain melts just a little bit:“Are you allowed to steal? No, You mustn’t steal. We agree on that. Except when you steal someone’s heart because that’s romantic. Or if you steal harmonicas from guys who play the harmonica at parties, because that’s being public spirited.” The ultimate takeaway here, is that we all have more in common with each other than we think. “‘Stockholm’ is, after all, an expression more than it is a place…everyone who doesn’t see us, doesn’t understand us, doesn’t care about us. Everyone has Stockholmers in their life, even people from Stockholm have their own Stockholders.” I loved this book, it was thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end and I couldn’t put it down.

But this is no ordinary bank robber or ordinary hostages. Its not really even an actual bank robbery that was committed. It was mainly a series of bad decisions that were made. Still when the police intervene and release the hostages, they do not find the bank robber. Its a bizarre situation, to say the least.WOW, WOW AND WOW!!!!. In a year that has been filled with so many disappointments its such a treat to come across this book. Fredrik Backman does not disappoint. Anxious People is a story about a bank robbery, a hostage situation and about idiots but its about so much more. When the police are alerted to a hostage situation in an apartment unit they take charge. Its the day before the new year so they do not have enough backup. They manage the best they can. The bank robber, who did not start the day intending to become a bank robber, now has a hostage situation that is also completely unintentional. This is an unconventional premise but it works. Backman works his magic on these \"quirky\" characters that you can not help but root for. In the process, he explains so accurately how it feels to be human (particularly in this point in time). The prose, as per usual, is fantastic. The structure and style flows in a such a way that it compliments the pace. And the title? Its spot on. There is nothing I dislike about this book. It is perfect.I have loved Backman since I first read A Man Called Ove. I have pretty much read everything by him (and have subsequently reread some of these books too) with the exception of one book. He is such a master of conveying a wide gamut of feelings and emotions through wit, humour and heart. He creates characters that stay with you long after you turn the last page. Anxious People is not an exception. At first glance at this premise, one finds it strange and, indeed, it is. But, I am not lying when I say its also so relatable. Backman provides some many keen observations, to which I was constantly nodding my head to. This work, like his previous ones, is so quotable. His characters are vivid and remarkable. Despite the fact that there are at least ten characters in this narrative, I remember them all. Backman gives a profound analysis of humanity while aslo providing a great story. A thoughtful, touching, witty and hearfelt book, this is a winner right here. Can not wait for his next book. Highly recommend this book! ...more I\\'ve previously shied away from Backman; I think I have a predisposition against having my heart warmed and it\\'s my impression that is his long suit.

But the premise of this one sounded just clever enough to override my reservations so I took the plunge, and I\\'m glad I did. I scratched a few notes to remind myself of what I found appealing in this book, the first of which is \"quirky\". I can\\'t say I was surprised to find, just now, that this word appears in pretty much every review on GR. I suppose if I had access to other languages I could find alternate words to capture this quality in the book, but since I\\'m limited to English, \"quirky\" will have to do. At its most basic level, the plot revolves around 8-10 people (depending on who is included in the count) who are participating in a real estate viewing of an apartment when a failed back robber rushes in brandishing a gun and seeking refuge. These people thus become inadvertent hostages. Although unknown to each other (except for 2 couples) it turns out that they have intersecting back stories. At the core of the book is the gradual reveal of these stories.All of this is done with an extremely light touch and plenty of humor reminiscent of a theatrical farce. It is those qualities that kept the book from becoming too gooey for my tastes. Three recurrent themes are the power and questionable decisions of banks, parent-child relationships - and suicide. I realize that \"quirky\", \"light touch\", and \"farce\" seem inconsistent with suicide, but Backman does pull it off. Some of these characters are warm and kind, while others are more acerbic. A line from a powerful woman banker: \"Do you know how many men like you every single woman on the planet meets every day who think that every thought that pops into your tiny little male brains is a lovely present you can give us?\" (OK, that one hit pretty close to home since just yesterday a notorious mansplainer of my acquaintance \"educated\" me on a topic about which I am far more knowledgeable.)The conclusion was too long and unnecessarily detailed for my tastes. I would have preferred to have the ultimate fates of these characters left a bit to my imagination. But overall I found it to be skillfully done and gently entertaining. ...more 4.25 ⭐️TW/CW: suicide, death of a loved one, depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, mentions of drugs abuse, mentions of domestic abuse, mentions of alcohol abuseI genuinely love Backman\\'s writing, but after reading and loving Beartown I think my expectations for this one were just a little to high.

This is a beautiful story on people and feelings and just a little bit of everything, it\\'s just that the style of storytelling was a bit confusing in this book compared to the other one I read. Trust me half of this book is just perfect sentences that describe exactly how all of us feel at times but could never put into words. That is the magic in this book, how it perfectly says what we all wish we could say, that it makes us feel seen and understood. But this also tried to come across as slightly comedic and those moments sometimes didn\\'t hit the mark with me and made the pacing of this book (FOR ME) slightly off and sometimes hard to get back into. The beginning was a little hard to get into because truly all the characters were acting like idiots, just how the narrator says they are. And it really didn\\'t make me want to keep going, but knowing the genius that is Backman and his full circle stories I knew I had to keep going and it\\'s a good thing I did because it is really a beautiful story.

The bank robber runs into a building and into an apartment that is being viewed by prospective buyers. They, of course, fear they are going to be robbed. The Bank Robber is not planning on robbing them but decides to hold them hostage, however these people are better described as” impossible” than “anxious” and taking them hostage is going to be a challenge. The two police officers Jim and Jack, father and son who are investigating the situation had me laughing out loud; starting when the officers are interviewing London the 20 year old (know it all) bank teller at the cashless bank.These characters would all have been perfect in a Seinfeld episodes ~ move over “Soup Nazi” now there could be “ Estelle and the Stockholmers, Zara and the Rabbit, Roger and Anna-Lena go shopping at Ikea, Jim and Jack deliver pizza, Ro, Julia and the Bank Robber go apartment hunting. Yes! each and every character is so unique. If you liked “Ove”…… YOU have got to read this!!Note: I always enjoy reading the Author’s Notes at the end of the book. In this case, author Backman calls it “Author’s Thanks” and yes even it is very clever. Additionally love when author provides a resource on an issue that was touched on in the story. So many people need help and are not sure where to turn. When an author supports resources, I believe and certainly hope it is viewed seriously!Want to thank NetGalley and Atria Books for this early release granted to me in exchange for an honest professional review.

And...I was right in thinking this wouldn\\'t be an author for me. The premise was interesting enough, more interesting than any of his pervious books have been for me. A bank robbery goes wrong and the bank robber winds up taking a group of people hostage at an apartment open house. As the plot progresses, we see how all the people in the apartment, including the bank robber and the policeman investigating the case are all connected. There were some sweet and poignant moments in the book for sure. I enjoyed the discussions of how prevalent anxiety is in our culture today, how quickly our lives can change and how to cope with that, and how the empathy and kindness of strangers can make a profound difference in the lives of others. But I couldn\\'t gel with the writing style and humor in this book. It felt at times that the author was trying very hard to be clever. And the characters were so over the top! It would have been fine if it was just one of them, but every character was a little too extra. None felt like real people. And the way the plot threads came together felt way too forced and convenient. I was constantly cringing and eye rolling so much that it took me out of the story. Not sure if I would read another Backman, but I\\'m glad I understand what the hype is all about now!  ...more At first I wasn\\'t sure I was going to like this one.

He built suspense, gave us a mystery to solve (how could the bank robber disappear) and several life stories to follow.Seemingly disjointed in the beginning, in a non linear style and with lots of backstories, everything will come nicely together just to blow you away!.   If Fredrik Backman sure knows how to build his story, what I admire most is his incredible penmanship.    I took notes all the time of so many quotes!    In just a few words, he makes you SEE evertything.    There is a depth, a wisdom in his analysis of life and human nature that is unmatched.    I think if he wrote a grocery list, I would still read it and find it insightful. .Just read it!\\xa0I just want to share two of my favorite quotes here from early on in the book to make you show you what I mean with being an amazing writer:\\xa0  \"It’s hardly surprising that people get confused and society is going to the dogs when it’s full of caffeine-free coffee, gluten-free bread, alcohol-free beer.\"  \\xa0  \\xa0    \"Jim was born in a generation that regarded computers as magic, Jack in one that has always taken them for granted.

This book is easily one of my favourite reads this year.Because the terrible thing about becoming an adult is being forced to realize that absolutely nobody cares about us, we have to deal with everything ourselves now, find out how the whole world works. Work and pay bills, use dental floss and get to meetings on time, stand in line and fill out forms, come to grips with cables and put furniture together, change tires on the car and charge the phone and switch the coffee machine off and not forget to sign the kids up for swimming lessons. We open our eyes in the morning and life is just waiting to tip a fresh avalanche of \"Don\\'t Forget!\"s and \"Remember!\"s over us. We don\\'t have time to think or breathe, we just wake up and start digging through the heap, because there will be another one dumped on us tomorrow.A bank robber goes into a cashless bank to rob it. This was the first mistake. The second was fleeing the bank and hiding in an apartment that\\'s hosting an open house. Now there are hostages to deal with, and even waving a gun doesn\\'t make them act as expected. The retired couple looking to renovate the apartment is too busy convincing everyone the place isn\\'t worth the hassle, the married couple about to have their first child is too busy fighting with each other to pay much attention to anything else, the banker is only there as a kind of hobby and isn\\'t at all impressed by the failed bank robber and the elderly woman just wants to make friends and feed everyone. And, of course, there\\'s the rabbit.This book isn\\'t really about the story. The hostage situation only serves as a backdrop for a book that is all about humanity. And there is so much to love about it The writing, for one, is absolutely brilliant. It\\'s witty and humorous and achingly painful in all the right moments. I\\'ve gotten into the habit of tabbing books when I\\'m reading them so I can reread some of my favourite lines, and I wasn\\'t even a quarter page in before I added the first one. I think some of the credit has to go to the translator, because I would never have guessed this wasn\\'t originally written in English. And it\\'s not like the writing is flowery either (although I have a real love for that kind of writing too). But the way Backman writes is simple and extremely effective. He uses a minimal number of words to make maximum impact, and it works.It was called a crisis in the financial markets, a bank crash, even though the only ones who crash are people.Aside from a way with words, Backman clearly has a talent for crafting characters. The way he describes people feels so real. Nothing is glossed over--these are humans with prejudices and problems, but Backman manages to shine a light on the positive attributes for each of the characters without being blatant about it. And none of them are what they appear to be at first glance. I had a label or box for each character--Roger was a controlling husband and Anna-Lena the wife who does everything Roger asks. This felt like the right boxes to put them in. The book was showing me all the signs that I\\'d categorized them correctly. But all my expectations and boxes and labels got completely subverted along the way, because people aren\\'t just one thing or another. You can\\'t put a person in a box and expect them to fit. There are bad and good things in each and every one of us, and first impressions aren\\'t the truth. I loved the way the characters developed, and by the end of the book I felt emotionally connected to each and every one of them. That\\'s no mean feat \\'cause we\\'re not talking about two or three characters here. I\\'m not much of a crier (only one book this year has managed to make me shed tears), but I felt myself choking up towards the end of this one.That\\'s an impossible thing for sons to grasp, and a source of shame for fathers to have to admit: that we don\\'t want our children to pursue their own dreams or walk in our footsteps. We want to walk in their footsteps while they pursue our dreams.There are enough twists in the plot itself to keep you hooked and eager to read more. Some of it I thought was predictable, but then it would get turned on its head by a new development. Definitely not a book you want to start reading when you have a busy work week ahead.All in all, this was thoroughly addictive on all fronts, and I am looking forward to reading all of Backman\\'s older and newer books. Can\\'t believe it took me this long to read one. ...more ***4.5***This one is a really great book. And often I remember Matt Haig while I read Backman and vice versa.

But after that it was a great story.“Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.”I don\\'t want to dive deep in to the plot as the blurb says it is a hostage drama where a bunch of idiots are held hostage by an idiot bank robber.

But the book actually talks about a lot more things through these bunch of people. And how they help each other in life. How a tiny bit of kindness will actually save people and that is all it is about. We be kind to each other and save those who can be saved.“God doesn\\'t protect people from knives, sweetheart. That\\'s why God gave us other people, so we can protect each other.”Happy Reading!!! ...more “They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.”This is my favorite of Backman\\'s books (that I\\'ve read) by quite a large margin.I would describe Anxious People as \"whimsical\" and \"pl “They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences.

That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.”This is my favorite of Backman\\'s books (that I\\'ve read) by quite a large margin.I would describe Anxious People as \"whimsical\" and \"playful\" except that would discount the reckoning with human pain and yes, anxiety, that also fills these pages. The truth is that is all of those things, and more! Honestly, all my favorite stories in any medium don\\'t confine themselves to just one genre or tone, but can be incredibly funny and moving and gross and profane and profound and silly and sentimental all in the same text, from one minute to the next. And all of it adds up to something more for me than it would have been as just a \"serious book\" about anxiety and the consequences of bad choices, and what it does to our brains just being human and living our lives.This will be my second book in a row that implores you to go in without really knowing anything beyond a very basic premise, which in this case could be described as \"hapless bank robber accidentally takes hostages\".I predicted several of the twists and reveals, but it was a pleasure to do so. The joy of this book does not depend on the \"reveals\" necessarily being surprises. In fact, for every instance in which I called a reveal, I really wanted that thing to happen, and was so, so happy when it did. I was happy for the characters and just happy in general. The pleasure in this story comes not just from the surprise of a twist well planned that will catch you off guard (there are some of those), but also in your expectations and hopes being met when you\\'ve figured it out in advance.My only reservation is that I feel like some phrases and use of individual words may have been lost in translation. That\\'s always a downside of translation, but it was worth noting here, because I kept wondering if the English phrases being used by translator meant something different than they did in the original Swedish. The biggest example is the word (view spoiler)[ \"idiots,\" which is used many times and in a variety of different ways, almost like a motif, so it wasn\\'t an insignificant thing to wonder if I wasn\\'t quite getting the meaning Backman originally was going for. I\\'m sure there were also subtleties I missed in Backman\\'s humorous use of \"Stockholm\" in its many variations, because I am not Swedish. Just something I was thinking while reading (hide spoiler)].I highly recommend this one, maybe even if you haven\\'t liked Backman\\'s other books.[4.5 stars] ...more In a word, brilliant!! I listened on audible and kept scrolling back to re-listen to a fabulous line. I found myself chuckling often and laughing at loud.

I can\\'t keep track of what\\'s a spoiler and what isn\\'t at this point. CharactersThere were like 10 characters in this book. Seriously. I\\'m not joking. The writing was in a third person limited and sometimes third person omniscient, but the limited changed from character to character. I loved learning about the backstories of each character. The author made all of these characters so different. Julia and Ro- I loved Julia and Ro. Their relationship was so pure and existed just because they wanted to make each other happy.

She\\'s an adorable old lady, but she\\'s just.. annoying sometimes. But the other times that she wasn\\'t annoying, I wanted to give her a hug. She was funny, but she also had a lot going on in her mind. Zara- hahaha nope. Psychopathic idiot. Not writing anything on her because I would rant for the rest of the review (:Roger and Anna-Lena- Roger is a innocent bean who must be protected at all costs. Anna-Lena does not deserve him. He was always so caring of his wife and would do anything for her. Anna-Lena is a controlling- You know what? I\\'m not even going to finish that statement.

We have a lovely mix of third person limited and omniscient with a bit of second person thrown in there for fun. It was fun to read and full of amazing quotes. The best part of this book was the heavy stuff. Somehow the author made the heavy stuff seem not as heavy. It deals a lot with suicide and that part was handled well. This fun, whimsical style of writing made it seem like it was more of a 200 page book rather than 500. PlotWhat plot? Seriously what plot? There was plot twist after plot twist after plot twist. My mind was exploding. All of these people are indirectly connected to each other and it makes sense. That was also one of the best parts about this book was how he connected almost every person to each other. It was mind blowing how he connected these people. Not to mention that when I cried it was at the end because a) the book ended and b) the way this author connected two people in this book was just perfection. Well. This book is a work of art in itself. The writing and the plot were written so well. It was honestly mind blowing to read about these characters and how a small little hostage situation brought them closer together. A little warning here, but this is an adult novel. I didn\\'t take that into consideration before I read it and having the mindset that this is an adult novel will make the impact completely different. Overall, a highly recommended book, but not for those faint of heart.  There were plot twists inside plot twists. And those plot twists had plot twists. Review and rating to come. ...more Anxious People is a book about a bank robber, a apartment viewing, a failed bank robbery and a chaotic hostage situation. A bridge is even thrown into the mix.

While this book had alot going on by the end of it all it was about one thing: humanity. Fredrick Backman is a amazing author who has a gift for words and adding a little much needed humor to serious topics. He has such a great way of writing about humanity and how all people connect to one another. How we can bump into a total stranger and never think about that person ever again or we could become the best of friends, that is the things he explores in this novel. How humans work and how human connection is more important then we know. This is very much a character driven story as most of the story progresses forward because of the characters. The characters were easily my favorite part of this book. I love how deep and complex these characters were like they could be real people. We had Jim and Jack, the father and son cop duo who both have very different methods of police work, Zara the sarcastic bank worker who behind her icy exterior hides a pained woman and Estelle, a sweet kind old lady with a heart of gold and nerves of steel and many more then I have mentioned here. The characters interactions with each other were so well done, how some people got along well while others not so much. I personally loved Jack and Jim, Zara and Estelle. Jack and Jim were so funny together and moments that they were together was both hilarious and heartwarming. Zara had so many funny lines but I found that she was the most interesting character and I loved seeing her grow. Estelle was such a sweetheart and I wish she was my grandmother and I cried when I read her story. This book was about humanity and how us humans interact and connect with each other. How one little thing can change a person\\'s life or could ruin it. One thing that I loved was how this book talked about parents and how parents are always judged by their mistakes. That was really interesting and thought provoking. Also how we look at other peoples lives and want what they have even though that life might be just smoke and mirrors. With this past year, we all had to sit down and think of our humanity and for some our mortality. This book does give me hope that humanity will find it\\'s way back to us again. This book was such a wonderful read and my first read by Mr. Frederick Backman and this one has inspired me to give his other books a try. I hope all of you will give this one a try. It is a true joy and very much needed. Thank you for inspiring me and many others Fredrick Backman. This will show you that humanity does and will continue to exist as long as we allow it to.  ...more Ok guys, I really, really enjoyed this one.

BUT, this is not some kind of gripping the edge of your seat crime story. It is amusing and humorous. The cast of characters all have their quirks and by the end are all likable. It is also a heartwarming story (as to be expected from Backman). I highly recommend this one! 4.5 stars. Thank you to the publisher for the review copy! ...more How does he do it?

I finally read A Man Called Ove next in September 2017, and he broke my heart again. And I would not have wanted it to be any other way.And here he does it again, after all these years.Anxious People is a book about a robbery at a cashless bank and a hostage situation with the world\\'s worst (read: best) hostages. But above all, it\\'s a story about idiots. It\\'s about idiots who have a lot of love to give and no way (or no one) to give it to. So people hold on to their love in the ways they know best, and as is life, some of it spills over. Luckily, they are surrounded by people who hold on to them, and also the spillage. There\\'s a priest and a police officer who try their best to save people. There\\'s a boy who managed to save someone and didn\\'t manage to save someone. There\\'s a woman who understands the complex economic system but doesn\\'t understand her loneliness. The two wives in the story accept that they are married to idiots, but that they are their goddamn lovable idiots. There\\'s an old lady who once had an affair. There\\'s also a monkey and a frog and a parent who would do anything for them. There are parents who are worried about not doing enough for their children, and there are children who are worried for their parents. There\\'s also a bridge that is connected to the story while also managing to connect the characters. Backman managed to tie all the loose ends into a wonderfully perfect story. Just what I hope out of life, for it to make sense in the end.“We can’t change the world, and a lot of the time we can’t even change people. No more than one bit at a time. So we do what we can to help whenever we get the chance, sweetheart. We save those we can. We do our best. Then we try to find a way to convince ourselves that that will just have to… be enough. So we can live with our failures without drowning.\"As much as I try, I fail to describe his writing. It is made up of words that tug at your heartstrings, make you break down, but then also piece you back together. I think the best way for me to describe it would be, that it is just wonderfully and perfectly Backman-style. I hope you do yourself a favour and read this book as soon as you can. \"They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.\"In the end, I am basing my trust on all the apartments that aren\\'t for sale. ...more One of the books I’ve most looked forward to reading this year is Anxious People by Fredrik Backman. I love this author’s way of storytelling, combining humour and well-developed, likeable characters. The story centres around a bank robber who enters a cashless bank only to recognize their mistake. Panicking, the robber flees across the street to an apartment where there is a real-estate showing to potential buyers. Upon entering, the robber is alarmed to see the expression of the apartment view One of the books I’ve most looked forward to reading this year is Anxious People by Fredrik Backman. I love this author’s way of storytelling, combining humour and well-developed, likeable characters. The story centres around a bank robber who enters a cashless bank only to recognize their mistake. Panicking, the robber flees across the street to an apartment where there is a real-estate showing to potential buyers. Upon entering, the robber is alarmed to see the expression of the apartment viewers and realizes their error of still carrying the gun. And so begins a hostage-taking.The story is told from two-standpoints: the eight hostages and robber inside the apartment as well as the father and son police duo responsible for the case. During each of the conversations, the personalities and backstories of the characters are slowly revealed. Moreover, as the hostage situation progresses, the depth of the information shared between hostages increases. Reminiscent of Abbott and Costello’s “Who’s on First” routine, the police interviews of the hostages is comedy at its best. It should also be noted that the book is also centred around an event ten years before that intersects with several of the characters. This event is addressed with sensitivity and compassion.I enjoyed this book immensely and it’s become one of my favourite reads of 2020. It was engaging and entertaining. The characters will very well developed and I appreciated their diversity. I also enjoyed the progression of the relationships between hostages from one of competition as potential buyers, to a small community of friends. I listened to the audiobook edition of the book narrated by Marin Ireland who gives an excellent performance. Her voice is clear and articulate and enjoyable to listen to.

They are trapped in an apartment showing after a bank heist has gone bad.

It’s like sharing an elevator with Hollywood mogul, The Rock. If you act too silly, his bodyguards will tackle you to the ground, his eyes judging you lacking as you sob and writhe on the carpeted floor. There is now no chance you will be invited to join him later tonight at Ben Affleck’s fancy Halloween party. But if you act too aloof, you will hurt The Rock’s feelings, he will think you are a jerk, and there will be no chance of you will be costarring in his next major blockbuster. It’s all about balance folks.For the most part Backman straddles this line with success, not unlike a member of the Flying Wallenda’s balancing on a steel wire stretched across Niagara Falls. Yes there are laughs that will cause you to expel pieces of the hotdog you were eating for lunch across the room. Depending on how much mustard and relish you dressed your dog with, these pieces may stick to the wall. But there are other moments in this book that will make you weep torrents of salty tears as if you have heard the final verse of “Puff the Magic Dragon” for the first time and must now live with the knowledge that there is no world where Little Jackie Paper and Puff can be together anymore. It is too late. While Dragons last forever, Jackie has grown up. I am not a particularly emotional person, my wife would say my level of emotions tend to align with fictional serial killer Dexter, but Anxious people had me feeling things that I have not felt in many years. Things I had to jam down back inside and lock away in the little blue wooden box I keep in my soul so nobody will hurt me ever again. It was uncomfortable and more than once I broke out in a rash.Still,  Anxious People (the first book I have read from this beloved author) was enjoyable and well worth the time and the agony of the feels.  ...more 3.5 stars.

I found the opening to be incredibly long-winded, repetitive and dare I say a bit tedious? So I put it down for a couple of days and read another book in the meantime which I loved and decided to carry on with Anxious People...and ended up loving it! I won\\'t go as far and say it blew me away but I really appreciated the messages and discussions characters had in this book. They were so profound and life-affirming despite the hard subject matters which plague nearly all of the characters and I came out of this book feeling like I knew a little bit more about the world and the people who live in it.I think out of all of the characters Zara had to be my favourite - she was an extremely complex and unlikeable character at times but she spoke her truth and was unapologetic for how she viewed the world. I\\'m not saying I agree with or share the same views that she does but she struck me as a strong yet vulnerable individual who was wracked with her own inner anxieties which underpins the whole cast. I particularly loved the conversations she had with her psychologist - again, there were so many profound quotes which came out of these discussions but also from other characters (I\\'m thinking of Roger, Anna-Lena and Estelle mainly) but they all contributed. There were some downright stupid moments (and the narrator frequently mentions the story is about idiots) and I did find that sometimes these irked me. I also found that having a cast of characters who all did or said idiotic things at one time or another was a bit \"convenient\" and seemed forced, but the author was probably highlighting how imperfect and complex human beings are and that even the most educated and well-to-do can be just as idiotic as the rest of us, and obviously this is pretty comical. I think for me the power and beauty of this book was the quote about bridges I included earlier - there is a lot of talk about bridges, what they mean, what they represent, how they are perceived, the roles they have played in various characters\\' lives but I really believed Roger\\'s quote about how they signify bringing people together because in this book people are brought together inadvertently by a bank robber (as an aside I called the reveal about the bank robber by the first 40-50 pages) and gradually they begin to open up, share their life experiences, reveal their secrets, their woes and even advise each other on the future. The connections these strangers had with each other by the end left me teary and deeply touched because this is a book about imperfect people, about mistakes/bad decisions we all make but how through these, we learn from each other and come out stronger on the other side. Yes it is a book about upsetting topics but it is also a book about hope, unity and perseverance, and a book that has made me stronger as a result.  ...more']"

This book is not only about Nora Seed who is trapped in her life, seeing herself a failure, a disposable human waste who has nothing to achieve, will never be missed by anyone . It’s about regrets, unfinished plans, what ifs, approval of families, drugs, mistakes, giving up, realizing other people’s dreams, self regret, insecurities, self harm, love, passion and hate...When Nora tries to end her life, she opens her eyes in a library filled with books which contain different versions of her life story. If she finds the right book and most proper life she can live fulfilled and happy, that will mean she can be saved! Thankfully the librarian Mrs. Elm here for here just like she has done when she was a little girl who recently learned she lost her dad. Nora could be a swimmer, a rock star, a philosopher, a wife, a traveler, a glaciologist, a mother, winery or local pub owner. She can say “yes” to her ex and accept his offer to live in a small town and own a local pub. Or she can say “yes” to coffee offer of a nice doctor candidate Ash to pursue happiness and love. She can win Olympic medals or she can taste the tempting charm of fame with her songs she writes and performs all around the world. She can be everything or anything. But after living so much lives, nearly thousand different versions, will she find which is best for her and which life form will suit to catch the real happiness? Can she live without family members or can she handle losing her friends to death? What does she really want? What does she expect ? And most importantly will she learn to face the things she regrets the most? Because however she’s ready to start her fresh life with open hands, those clutches of regret always pull her back and prevent her to see what she’s really looking for! Beautiful, meaningful, dazzling, emotional, heart wrenching, poetic, realistic : these are the words which come to my mind after reading this book. Just like the definition of ideal life.

His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora\\'s eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It\\'s A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more.

But, I must be honest. As much as I wanted to LOVE this, I just wasn’t AS riveted by the explorations of “what could have been”. This will appeal to those who enjoy stories which revolve around sliding doors, alternate realities and time travel. That isn’t me. I gravitated toward it because of the appeal of the library.We all know that books resonate (or don’t resonate) with readers based on our own personal experiences. Perhaps if you share a certain regret with our leading lady, Nora, you will connect with this book more than I did. Perhaps, it was just timing.This book has almost all 5 star reviews, so please read others for an alternate opinion. Or, if you are one of the few, who like me, LOVED the idea more than the story, know now that there is at least one other person who felt the same way as you. ...more (4.5?)

Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening to Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine at the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her.Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one the lives in particular was more interesting than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. Many liked The Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book. But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events of this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, the majority liked this book so you might too and it\\'s simply not my cup of tea. ...more Okay.

It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn\\'t see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”It\\'s a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would\\'ve been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I\\'m the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life. “A person was like a city. You couldn\\'t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don\\'t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I\\'m obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious.  “It is easy to mourn the lives we aren\\'t living. Easy to wish we\\'d developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we\\'d worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn\\'t make and the work we didn\\'t do the people we didn\\'t do and the people we didn\\'t marry and the children we didn\\'t have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It\\'s the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people\\'s worst enemy. We can\\'t tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.” But god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end.

Normally, I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, and I\\'ll try to put into words why.For one thing, this story doesn\\'t come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be understood if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim-witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it\\'s really hard to connect with Nora. She\\'ll take a situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what\\'s left in the most negative way possible. She\\'s full of regret for every decision she\\'s ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She\\'s a blank slate, dull and uninteresting. I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. I\\'m also uncomfortable with the implication that if you\\'re depressed, you only need to change your outlook and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it\\'s important to seek out professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it\\'s not a matter of not trying hard enough.So many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it\\'s just not for me. This is the second book I\\'ve read by Matt Haig, and I\\'ve had trouble connecting with both. So I think it\\'s time I part ways with this author and just accept that we are not compatible. ...more I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top.

I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.  “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.” And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:  “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.” Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:  “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.” And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————  The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide.   “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.” This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.  “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.” In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those. “Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?” And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.  “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.” And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.    “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.” And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite.  “I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.”  2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.———— “You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too. ...more 2021 F.A.B.

Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’Nora is going through a terrible period in her life, where everything that could possibly go wrong, does. She’s consumed with regret over the paths not taken, wrong decisions made. In the throes of depression, she decides suicide is the answer. She has nothing and no one to live for.This is when Nora ends up in the Midnight Library, a sort of limbo between life and death. Part ‘It’s A Wonderful Life’ and part ‘Sliding Doors’, every book in the library represents a parallel universe with a life she could have lived had her choices been different. All she has to do is choose a book and she will automatically be dropped into that life. Each time she is dropped into an alternate life, she does so with no prior memory of her life up to that point. She knows she has been dropped in and must wing it and figure out how to fit in seamlessly. There’s a bit of humor when she must google herself and check her social media accounts for clues. In one life she thinks she must have been very happy because she wasn’t very active on social media (ha).If she loves a life she has a choice to stay. But if she begins to feel disillusioned, she returns to the library, where an infinite number of possibilities awaits. The problem with infinite possibilities is the thought that something better awaits had a different path been chosen.Each decision/life contains unforeseen consequences, some good and some bad. Is the grass always greener? It is easy to imagine there are easier paths, but are there? The problem with regrets is they are rarely based on fact. Understanding the nuances and importance of our lives are not always obvious.I won’t ruin the surprise by revealing more of what Nora discovers or decides. It’s much more fun to discover it on your own. While this book could have been predictable or schmaltzy, the author has written a unique, delightful, and thought-provoking story. There are surprises in store and it’s impossible to read without reflecting on your own life choices. This was a terrific choice for a buddy read with my friend Marialyce, and it would be an excellent choice for a book club.I was grateful for the highlighting function on my kindle, as I highlighted a lot. In the midst of a pandemic and social unrest, it’s natural to worry about the future, but this book was a good reminder to make the best of this life we’ve been given.Knowing the author has struggled with depression and thoughts of suicide made this book all the more meaningful: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandst...•\\tPublication date August 13, 2020.

Nora Seed might seed our mind with melancholy and heart with love in her quest for perfection. Can perfection be attained through the careful movement of the pawns in this deliberate game of life? Through the underlying current of sadness, this literature transcends us to a library between the universes with a librarian who is a mental metaphor that can be fathomed only by a few. “Aisles and aisles of bookshelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor. Books were everywhere. The shelves really did seem to go on forever, straight and long to the far off horizon. There were no title and names adorning the spines of the books.”  The library between life and death with a vagabond poacher through multiverses, who gave an open invitation to death and didn’t want to be preserved from death as she can’t decide how she wants to live. “You don’t go to death, but the death comes to you”  The fact that the day never ends due to the never-ending light is like living one terminal day. It is exceptionally depressing for an already depressed person who decided to die by traveling with her best companion - solitude from a society so lonely owing to the detachment due to the extreme social media attachment.Does life seem more attractive in the face of death? Is death the one that makes life beautiful? Is death an obligate parasite that wants to change the relationship to a symbiotic one with life?Is the simplification of the three-dimensional worlds by humans making it more complicated? “This is the wrong life. It is really, really, really wrong. Take me back. I do want to avenge. Take me back to the library.In the cosmic order of things, there is no rejection only redirecrtion.”  Can a person cry due to sadness, smile due to the speck of light at the end of the tunnel, and be surprised due to the philosophical brilliance at the same time. The reading experience of this book gives us that unique experience.   “The thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory.”    ...more Boring!This sort of contemporary fiction is not something I normally read or like, so don\\'t rely on my opinion for this book.

I felt that the basic concept in both these books is so similar that TJR might say \\'MH, you imitated my idea!\\'. My response would be that the big difference is The Midnight Library is written with and for a purpose. That\\'s exactly what The Midnight Library is about - `a purpose` to save a life by making the person realise the importance of being alive, understand the infinite possibilities, and guiding towards giving a perspective and not taking things for granted. All this is done by staying serious yet funny, with genuineness and not being casual.The Midnight Library, which can also be named as \\'The Many Lives of Nora Seed\\', explores the many lives of a young woman, Nora Seed, at a time when she has decided to give up her life, and is in fact \\'in between life and death\\'.Matt Haig should consider writing this for the big screen and give it to Christopher Nolan, and Christopher will make a masterpiece out of the script.***`Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations.

As Nora was to discover, we all \"fear life\" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences. Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you\\'ve never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you\\'ve read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora\\'s attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora\\'s mother\\'s family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel. Nora\\'s Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm\\'s struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get \"unstuck.\" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word \"potential.\" I totally agreed with Nora\\'s final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can\\'t live someone else\\'s life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.This author - this book - has a lot to teach us. I am so very glad that I decided to check out what all the hype was about: turns out, all that hype was fully merited ! Loved every bit of it, including the sad parts. A full five out of five glowing stars for this heart-stirring, sanity-saving novel. We all need to burn our own book of regrets... and just get on with living our best life NOW!

Let\\'s get back to my super uninformative book review. As I was saying, this book reminded me a lot of The Family Man and all those other movies (and movies/stories like them) that I referenced earlier. It deals with regret and the realization that it\\'s all about perspective. And I really enjoyed that aspect. It\\'s definitely a valuable lesson that has been around for ages, but it\\'s always great to be reminded of it...especially in this age of social media. Constant comparison has never been so in your face...all the time...As I said, if not for the ending, I would have really loved this. I really liked Molly. And while I didn\\'t necessarily need a blatant HEA depicting Molly in the future...I would have at least liked Nora to end up in a place where we knew Molly was probably going to happen. But anyway, that\\'s all I got.

It’s a book about recognizing all the possibilities of your life, but it’s more about letting go the regrets of what you could have been. Nora Seed is miserable, miserable enough to be not only thinking about suicide, but acting on it. Instead of the blackness of death, she awakes in the Midnight Library accompanied by her Elementary School librarian, Mrs. Elm. Mrs. Elm explains that the library is filled with books that represent all the possibilities of her life, an infinite number of paths, created by an infinite number of choices. When she chooses a book, she will be transported into the life, and can live it until she decides if it’s a life she would want to continue.Haig writing is strong; clever, clean, and no distractions. The book is full of great observations and insights.“A person was like a city. You couldn\\'t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don\\'t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”We get deep into Nora’s character and she felt genuine in her struggles to me. If anything bothered me about her character it was how talented she was. How many people have the talent to be Rockstar, an Olympic Swimmer, a successful Ted Talk speaker, etc. etc. However, I can forgive this, as it serves to drive home the central theme of the book.My bigger problem is the mechanism that allows Nora to revisit her past, a suicide attempt. Largely, Haig handles this delicate subject well. I appreciate authors that take on subjects as challenging as suicide, but it\\'s dangerous to have the suicide attempt itself be the mechanism that triggers a chance to relive your life. Why? Because somewhere out there, someone is struggling so hard, that have such regrets, that they will talk themselves into believing anything. I enjoy Time Travel books and I follow a number of Facebook groups dedicated to this subject. In those groups I have found that there are a concerning number of people that have such anguish over a past decision or choice that they want desperately to believe that time travel is possible. They beg, plead, and even offer money for people to reveal the secrets that will allow them to travel to their past to change their past choices. If someone is suicidal, any idea that suicide itself might provide a chance to relive their life is unsafe. Suicide is never the answer and only wastes the potential of a valuable life. So while I applaud Haig for taking on this important subject, I just wish the method that triggered the journey to the Midnight Library were different; a magic potion, a freak accident, a visit by an angel, anything but a suicide attempt.A well-written parable of one women’s journey to move beyond her regrets and find meaning in her life through a supernatural library that’s filled with books that represent all her possible lives. ...more Be sure to visit Bantering Books to read all my latest reviews.3.5 starsI didn’t love The Midnight Library.

It should’ve been a slam-dunk read. Because the story has so much of what I enjoy – a magical library, clever writing, a cat.What’s not to love? Right?Unfortunately, I can think of a few things.Nora Seed has hit a rough patch. Feeling saddened by her life choices, she enters the Midnight Library – a library housed between life and death, where there are endless shelves filled with an infinite number of books, each one containing a slight variation of Nora’s current life.By simply opening a book, Nora is transported to an alternate reality, and she is able to see how she would have turned out had she only made a different decision. Would she have been happy as a glaciologist? Or a singer in a band? Or if she had married? Or pursued Olympic swimming?Presented with the opportunity to undo her past mistakes, Nora must decide for herself which of her many, many possible lives is the one most worth living.I can certainly see why The Midnight Library has resonated with so many readers. It’s a story about regret, which is a theme to which every single one of us can likely relate. I’m sure we all regret something that we did or didn’t do and have therefore felt, at one time or another, the pain and heft of regret’s burden.But for all of its relatability, the novel is also quite dark, with the story being centered around suicide and depression – two subject matters that some readers may find to be disturbing and triggering. (Consider yourself forewarned.)To Haig’s credit, however, he neither delves too deeply, nor too heavily into the topics. He keeps the story fairly close to the surface, only dipping his toe in just enough to give the reader sufficient character insight. In addition, the tone of Haig’s writing is warm and gentle, and he does an excellent job of inserting light moments of humor into the narrative to counteract its bleakness.And Haig also adds a touch of bright, magical fantasy to the story by creating the wondrous Midnight Library – only to then swiftly explain away and bury that magic beneath theories of physics and philosophy.Boring theories of physics and philosophy, I should say. And this is part of the reason why The Midnight Library did not enamor me.By taking away the magic of the story and replacing it with science fiction, the story is bogged down and often difficult to wrap one’s head around, giving it a bit of a textbook feel. I had to fight hard to keep my interest and focus intact.And not only is the novel too laden with science fiction for my tastes, but after a while, it also begins to feel less like a story and more like one big, inspirational pep talk. A heavy-handed, in-your-face pep talk. Haig slings life lesson after life lesson at the reader, self-improvement message after self-improvement message, with zero subtlety. He gives us no space to draw our own conclusions and interpretations. He does not trust us to correctly connect all the dots.For me, Haig’s lack of faith in the reader is what finally does the novel in. By S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G everything out, he noticeably weakens the impact of The Midnight Library. What could have been an exceptionally powerful and emotional read, instead falls flat. Clearly, my opinion lies in the minority. And by no means is it my intention to discourage anyone from reading this well-received novel. Many of you will respond to it far differently than I did. So, here is my wish for those who read it – May you love it. May you treasure it. May you find within the pages of The Midnight Library all the magic you hope to find.And all that I did not.

As Nora goes through various scenarios, each layer of her existence is peeled back like an onion. It becomes more clear what made her so unhappy in life, but also what was out of her control...and what she shouldn’t feel guilty for.There are scenarios that I feel could have been expanded upon, and others that could’ve been skipped. At the end of the day, I enjoyed this fictional story, but hoped there would’ve been a bit more behind it. I never got the feels that I was expecting. I cared about Nora and wanted her to be content, but the impact of her story wavered for me. I DID love the very fitting chapter names. My favorite?

What she is not planning is ending up in The Midnight Library, where each book represents a life she could have lived if she made different choices in her life. Her guide book, almost, is her book of regrets, all the regrets that she had her life. She begins to select books in the library, going to that life she could have lived if she made different choices, and you see all the possibilities. But in each of these lives, does she truly find the happiness that she is looking for?I can\\'t do this one justice. I loved the story, loved the audio (narrated by Cary Mulligan), loved the character. It was a buddy read with Dana and we both really enjoyed it and were so happy with the audio narration. This book brought on some great discussions plus some soul searching and thinking about life. Some time ago I downloaded a copy of this book from Edelweiss, forgetting that I had it. I\\'m glad I procrastinated on the print as it really was a top audio narration for the year for me as well.

There are an infinite number of lives where even the smallest decision can have a massive impact. A lot like The Butterfly Effect. I found the physics side of it to go over my head a lot, but I enjoyed following Nora into the different lives and different things that could have happened to her. It’s pretty dark in places, there is a strong emphasis on mental and emotional well-being and what that means. Also our regrets are often unfounded. Our ‘perfect’ life had we made different choices is most likely not perfect at all.

So, I picked up the can and I opened, thinking that was filled with cookies... Instead of it, there were needles and wool buns. Latinxs know about this kind of disappointment.This was this book for me. A big ass disappointment.The synopsis of this book was promising, full of excitement and hyped. The hype of The Midnight Library was incredibly huge. I liked the synopsis and said: \"yes, this may be worthwhile\". But I\\'m naive, friends. I never learn from my past mistakes.So, Nora Seed is a depressed woman who thinks her life is meaningless. She was fired from her job, her cat died, she has many regrets in her life (family, friends, love, job, ec.) that she can\\'t stand it anymore. The final straw is when her cat dies, she realizes that there is no point in living anymore. So, she kills herself drinking a lot of pills.When Nora wakes up, she\\'s in a library. But she seems to be alone, until she finds Mrs. Elm, the librarian of Nora\\'s school who was kind with her. This woman offers to Nora the possibility to know the lives Nora could\\'ve lived if she had made different decisions. And so, Nora starts her journey. Long story short: Nora realizes that she doesn\\'t wanna die. That some of her lives are not the way she wanted, that are disappointing, boring or don\\'t make her happy.Honestly, if I had the chance to try other lives that I could\\'ve lived if I hadn\\'t regretted many things, I would totally say yes. Because, let\\'s face it: it would be amazing to know the things we could have done different. So, perhaps in another life, I would have studied medicine, or modern languages (English and French), or History, or made excercise, or talked more with the girl that I liked, or if I had saved more money, or if I had obtained better grades, or if in another life, I would be your girl...Just kidding.But, that\\'s not gonna happen. I have this life because I made some decisions (and I regret all of them, but still, here am I). Because we all made decisions that brought us all to where we are. We could be happy in another life? Who knows. We could be miserable, just like Nora when she lived the life where she married Dan. I gotta say that I wasn\\'t surprised for the \"plots\" in this book. I saw coming many many many things in here. The writing was pretty, I\\'m not gonna lie because it was kind of deep. There were many philosophical quotes and thoughts and references that were pretty deep and confusing at the same.Some characters were flat, boring and simply; they contributed nothing to the plot or to the MC. Nora has some deeper and worryign depression. I suffer of depression, but I\\'ve never made it to that point, so I can\\'t say much about it. I didn\\'t relate with her or get attached with her either or the side characters at all. I just didn\\'t care for her, or get related or even attached. Please, don\\'t stone me for this; I\\'m being totally honest.Dylan was ok and sweet but I hated the comparison to a dog that Nora made of him. Ash was someone gentle, nerd and also sweet, but honestly we never get to know them very well. They\\'re part of some of Nora\\'s lives, but they\\'re not relevant at all. Just like her parents, her brother, her ex fianceé, her best friend, yada, yada, yada... She made some decisions / or didn\\'t for them, and lived some lives without those decisions (trust me, I got confused too at some point) that she didn\\'t enjoy at all. Nora also met another traveler just like her, Hugo, but he called them \"slidders\", I don\\'t remember very well.At some point, Nora finds out that none of those lives are really satisfying, and therefore, she was back in the Midnight Library, in which, time is frozen at 00:00:00, because she was and wasn\\'t dead. Nora discovers that many of the decisions that she made or didn\\'t made were ok... And when she thought she found the perfect life it turns out that she finds she\\'s living a lie, she\\'s faking and pretending to be a mother, a wife and a good person, having a good and perfect life.Long story short, the library is falling apart and Nora must to write in the only book in blank. So, she gets back to life, but in her root life, she was dying, so she asked for help. She learned the lesson and decides to live her life.This is a self-help book. Not that is wrong tho. No, I\\'m not meaning that... It\\'s just that I was waiting  more . I was expecting more from an overhyped book, which I\\'ve seen many 4/5 stars rant (note: if you liked it, good for you, because I tried so hard) and sometimes I wonder if I\\'m not a heartless and cold bitch lmao.Anyhow, this book isn\\'t bad. Perhaps my most depressed 17-year-old self would\\'ve enjoyed this with more passion and even shed tears like a bitch. Because, trust me, this is the kind of book that 17 yo me would\\'ve needed and really yearned. I had and have many dark times, folks, that\\'s why I picked up this book in first place, but, my dark moments are anecdotes for another day.It was bittersweet to me. The ending was rushed and cheesy? I can\\'t even find the word to describe how it made me feel.I do like the message that this book is telling. I really really do. I just learned something: please don\\'t consider suicide as the solution to all of your problems. Believe me, I\\'ve been there, a lot of times, but that\\'s not the answer to anything. This is an advice from someone who has suffered from depression since 13: you are not alone, you are important, you matter. Please, talk to someone and get help. You may thing it doesn\\'t help, that it can\\'t make a difference, but it does. We all have our regrets, but we also have our succeses: those little victories that you achieve every day, even if you don\\'t notice it.Anyhow, this is my review and if you liked/loved this book, I\\'m so so so glad for you, because I wish that would be me.I\\'m sad that this books goes straight to my \"big hype big lie\" shelf. :/_________________________________________buddy read lia, katie, mel, juls, lucia, sofia, lacey, ish, tisha, ayla_________________________________________i\\'ve read mixed reviews and now idk what to think, please just don\\'t let me down *fingers crossed* ...more I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want.

Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’  For a brief moment, as this story begins, a young Nora Seed is sitting in the small library at her school, her school librarian, Mrs. Elm, is playing a game of chess with Nora, and while Nora is intently staring at the chess board, Mrs. Elm shares a bit of wisdom with young Nora, saying ‘...you could be anything you want to be, Nora. Think of all that possibility. It’s exciting.’Nineteen years later, Nora is sitting on her sofa, when a man she recognizes, but doesn’t really know well, rings her doorbell, reluctantly, in order to deliver bad news to her. She makes a decision that will, ultimately, she can no longer go on, and tries to commit suicide, but ends up in a library which offers her a choice - to return to live, to choose from a seemingly endless selection of books - lives, to which she may enter a new variation of her own life. Serving as the librarian of this library of life choices is her old school librarian, Mrs. Elm, who gently guides her in understanding how this all works. Asking questions, Mrs. Elm helps Nora find the various paths that she might have chosen in another life. One by one, she experiences the various other paths she might have chosen, tackling decisions that she has often regretted, or wondered if her life might have turned out to offer a more fulfilling, happier life.

I realize that I’m in the vast minority with that opinion, and I’m truly happy for all the people who loved and found support in this book, but I also feel like I there are some things that need to be said contrary to all the praise. First things first: we start our story with Nora, a young woman on the day she decides to die. Having been recently fired and having lost her cat, best friend and contact with her brother, she feels so hopeless about life that she attempts suicide. To her surprise, she finds herself waking up in a library: the library between worlds. Here, every book contains an alternative version of her life, had she made different decisions, giving her a glimpse into what might have been, but also offering her a second chance of that life. There’s only one condition: she can only stay in that life, if she’s completely happy with it.The Good: I like Matt Haigs narrative voice. I like how accessible he made these very difficult topic in this novel, and the way he streamlined this novel. This is the kind of story that only needs a single plotline, and I’m happy that Haig focussed on that, instead of adding in unnecessary subplots that would have taken away from the primary one. Honestly, the rest of the novel just wasn’t  good to me. It was just  okay. Safe. Bland. And one that has been done time and time again in different forms of media in just this exact way. The Bad: I’m trying to keep this short, so we can get to the real heart of the problem sooner: -\\tUnoriginal/predictable/bland I’ve read/watched/heard this story a million times before, and I based on the synopsis I could have written it out beat for beat for you, and I would have been 100% correct. Matt Haig does nothing original or impactful with this trope. -\\t“Nothing matters”The majority of this book focusses on Nora living through her alternative lives. Unfortunately, as we known how many pages we have left (and probably how this book will end), we know none of them will stick. Therefore none of what she does during these sections matters. Nora as a character also completely lacks any agency: she wants to be \"happy\", but has no concrete image of what that would be or how to achieve it, making it hard to identify with her as our \"heroine.\" -\\tSentimentalSeriously, this book is basically actively wrenching the tears from your eyes. It tries so hard to be profound and emotional that it fell completely flat for me. The emotional beats were very “engineered”: I could practically hear the sad piano music swell as the important paragraphs arose. It’s so cheap and reminds me of the problem I have with “sick-lit”: using the suffering of a character with an illness to get cheap emotion out of an audience of able-bodied people. The Ugly: When covering this type of subject matter, you know your book is going to be influential to readers who identify with it. For that reason, you have to get this right, which is why I’m extra critical of these stories. The margin of error is tiny, and well meant advise can in fact be harmful to the wrong person at the wrong time. *SPOILER ALERT* I guess, although if you haven’t figured out the direction this book would take by now, you clearly haven’t seen as many movies/books with these themes as I have. In the end, Nora discovers that her original life (the one she wanted to escape so badly), was her best life after all. Despite the challenges she faces, the learns to see all the good in her original life and decides to return to it. The message of “just don’t be sad and look at all the good you have” is not one that is helpful with people suffering from true depression or suicidal ideations. It’s also a very (for lack of a better term) “privileged” stance to take. Yes, Nora’s life has a lot of good: she has friends, parents, a brother, a roof over her head, money, good health, opportunities… So many people who are in a low enough place to contemplate suicide do not have many or even any of these things. Not to mention, for someone suffering from depression, none of this will matter to their well-being. Depression is an illness, NOT a choice. “Just focus on the good” is a cheap and easy cop-out, and an insult to a large portion of the people this book pretends address. ...more 3.5 stars, rounded upI’ve always had a thing for stories about parallel lives.

Upon the cessation of life, she finds herself in a library with book upon book, all based on how her life would have turned out if she had made one different decision. By opening the book, she gets a chance to live that life. It’s an engaging story, as we see Nora placed into the life she would have been living if she had just made these different decisions. The interesting thing is she is truly just placed in that life. She doesn’t have the “background” she would have if she’d been living that life the entire time. While it hits some deep topics, the book is fairly obvious and simplistic. The points Haig is making don’t take a philosophy degree to figure out. No life is perfect, there will always be regrets. But credit where credit is due, I still wanted to see how all of Nora’s lives would play out. It’s a fun listen, if not a deep one. This would probably make a decent book club selection.

I think everyone should pick this book up at some point in their lives.

Every move had been a mistake, every decision a disaster, every day a retreat from who she imagined she’d be.” And just as she decides to take her own life, she finds herself in a library between life and death: and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices. Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?Through the library, she can leave her “root life” and explore a multiverse’s worth of different versions of herself. If she finds a life she wants to remain in badly enough, she will, and she’ll forget her past and the library and eventually it will be as if she had always been there. Will you be shocked by the twists and turns of this tale? I doubt it; it’s not that kind of book. There’s enough world-building to generally explain the rules of the library, but don’t look too closely or it it probably crumbles (for example, there’s no mention of what happens to the versions of herself that she displaces every time she ‘slides’). And for someone so troubled and lost that she had just attempted suicide, Nora is amazingly perceptive about the problems in the lives of these other versions of herself.Instead, The Midnight Library is a deliberately optimistic story in which Nora comes to realize that she does want to live, and that while her root life may be troubled, it is still more right for her and more worth living than some other possible version—or no life at all. If you think this sounds a little bit like the movie It\\'s A Wonderful Life, the author has freely admitted that this book was inspired by that movie. But he previously wrote a memoir about his battles with depression and nearly committing suicide when he was younger, so he certainly has a personal stake in writing a book about \"acceptance and realising that often you have a lot more than you think.” Nora sees how she affected those around her, and was loved by them, despite her pain. She realizes that she needs to stop trying to live out the dreams others had for her, and let go of her regrets.* The Midnight Library is a sort of parable, with a bit of a pop psychology and pop philosophy (and chess metaphors) mixed in. It reminded me of The Five People You Meet in Heaven. But the story works. It’s sweet and inspiring, and it lifted my spirits. Real people like Nora are out there, silently struggling, and you root for her (and them) to find their way out of the dark, to realize they would be missed and have much to live for. I hope the people who would be comforted by this book find it. Recommended.*It’s a bit too revealing to include in the review, but there’s a great quote on this idea that I’ve placed in the first comment for when I want to go back and remind myself of its wisdom. ...more Nora Seed is extremely depressed. Life isn’t going her way. She’s 35, she’s left her fiance, she’s on the outs with her best friend, her beloved cat just died on the heels of her mother’s death, she’s lost her job, she’s let down her brother and bandmates by quitting their band on the verge of potential stardom due to her anxiety, and she lives with the regrets of failing her father’s once lofty dreams for her Olympic swimming career. Everywhere she turns she sees her life as a hopeless failure  Nora Seed is extremely depressed. Life isn’t going her way. She’s 35, she’s left her fiance, she’s on the outs with her best friend, her beloved cat just died on the heels of her mother’s death, she’s lost her job, she’s let down her brother and bandmates by quitting their band on the verge of potential stardom due to her anxiety, and she lives with the regrets of failing her father’s once lofty dreams for her Olympic swimming career. Everywhere she turns she sees her life as a hopeless failure and herself as a disappointment. In her despair, she decides she wants her life to be over and takes steps to end it. In the limbo between life and death she finds herself in the Midnight Library.This magical library, overseen by a version of Mrs. Elm, Nora’s kindly grade school librarian, offers Nora the opportunity to choose “books” that are variations on her life that exist in a kind of alternate universe. In theory, think of it like a fitting room in a clothing store, where she’s able to try on lives to see if there’s one she wants to buy into. The only catch is that the library and any opportunities therein will disappear forever if she doesn’t ultimately decide she wants to live.I know. The description sounds pretty gloomy and dark, and I can’t argue too hard that it isn’t at least mildly depressive at times, but I would argue that it has a really beautiful and profoundly good point for all of us:Don’t live a life of regret.There were so many quotes that spoke to me in this book, but these are a few that stood out:“It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out.”“...there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness forever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.”“...we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.”“We only know what we perceive. Everything we experience is ultimately our perception of it. ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’”This book is deeply philosophical, so if that’s not your thing, you may not enjoy this one. I think Matt Haig is making his argument to the world to find the possibilities and contentment in the life you have, to appreciate the life you’ve been given and to live the life you want, not what others want or dream for you. Sometimes a good or bad life is simply determined by what we believe it to be. If you can see the point in the book, it’s brimming with hope and possibility!★★★★ ...more This Review ✍️ Blog 📖 Twitter 🐦 Instagram 📷    “Pressure makes us, though.

Anyway, I think I am a bigger fan of Haig’s fiction than his non-fiction. I tried Reasons to stay alive but I thought it was okay. This was better in my opinion, had very important messages and it was more fun to read. I think I am going to be discovering Haig’s fiction books in the future.The book is about a Midnight library that contains books and these books show us all of the possibilities that we could have lived. The protagonist Nora visits this library due to circumstances she’s going through, we get a quick glance about her life in the beginning and then we start getting to know her through all the options she could have lived. I think the idea is not new (Earlier this year I read Again Again which had a similar concept) but the execution was excellent. I think it is the best book with this concept that I have read so far. (A trigger warning for animal death at the start of the book.)Haig’s writing is very digestible in this book and I think it is an adult book that can be easily read by younger readers. I have to confess that I liked the very fast pacing and short chapters because it makes it almost impossible to put down and you’re just curious to see what options we will see next and how it will end overall. That being said I think the overall message gets clear early in the story and the ending is not hard to guess but that does not make it any less important because that’s the best most positive ending in my opinion and we got that.    “And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.”  Summary: The Midnight Library is a sci-fi/ Contemporary story that has important messages. The book is fast-paced, short and it is a perfect quick read if you are looking for that but it discusses some heavy topics so take that in mind too. I liked the protagonist and the fact that she’s 35 and she’s still trying to figure out her life. The idea is very interesting and the execution is very well done. I do recommend it if you are a fan of the genre.You can get more books from Book Depository ...more The concept was good, sounded promising, almost magical, and yet the book itself wasn’t. It lacked depth, the premise was too unembellished.

what if she’d kept swimming professionally? what if she’d said yes to the guy who asked her out for coffee? what if…? you get the idea. what follows is nora’s journey as she explores all these infinite possibilities, in which her other / parallel / alternate selves keep surprising her by whom they’ve become. and as she does, she tries to find that one life that makes her happy and is worth living.i liked the concept. the execution less so.first off, it’s very easy to predict this novel from beginning to end. i know, i know; sometimes it’s more about the journey than the destination. but i’d expected haig to take a slightly more interesting approach than simply having nora live a life for a couple of pages, learn her lesson, and move onto the next one.the lessons are given to the reader and nora in very on-the-nose, philosophy 101 dialectics kind of way. seriously, at times i felt i was back in my undergrad communications class with a bunch of very awkward students practicing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques on each other.often, the way haig gets these life lessons to the reader is also very clumsily constructed in a way that almost detracts from the narrative.for example: in one of her lives, nora has become a famous figure who gives inspirational speeches. she goes on to give a TED talk to a huge audience, and starts musing about her recent experiences with her ‘life hopping’ and how our lives are really just infinite branches on a tree. likewise, in many of her lives, nora writes poetry and posts her thoughts on social media. “hello there, reader, let me tell you about the Philosophy of Life,” said the author as he set up yet another poem / speech / monologue / song lyric to speak to the reader directly through his mouthpiece of a bland protagonist.look, if i’d want to read such overt inspirational bullshit, i’d pick up a self-help book or browse social media, not read a book about a depressed person trying to deal with the reality of being suicidal. me while reading this book: all of them but mostly A but, let’s talk positives here for a second. because they are there, believe me.obviously, some of the adventures that nora gets up to in certain lives are fun to read about -- such as her Arctic Life or her Ash Life (keeping this deliberately vague to circumvent spoilers). she continually surprises herself with who she can possibly become, and that slowly opens up her mind to seeing more possibility and potential in herself and her original life.the brief dive into nora losing her grip on reality and her own identity was a particularly nice touch, as well. because who are you truly if you’ve seen so many different iterations of yourself? so different from who you thought you were that they might not even be you anymore?i thought this was a great topic in general to include since depression often feels like it erases your identity in some ways already -- it takes away your joy, your hobbies, everything that can make you feel like you.there are also some quotes scattered throughout that were pretty good (see the one at the top of this review), even if haig’s chopped, staccato style of writing is not entirely to my tastes.the ending, though, was another let-down.(view spoiler)[of course, nora comes to the realization that even though her original life is a big damn mess, at least it’s her damn mess, and she finds her will to keep on living through it. and when she comes to and recovers from her suicide attempt… all her problems are gone. she revisits old friends and family, considers getting a dog, rearranges her life to better fit her needs -- her depression has disappeared completely. there’s zero follow-up on her still taking her meds or even going into therapy.it’s such a jarring, sugary-sweet wrap-up of a genuinely harrowing experience. i get that haig probably wanted to end on a positive note to show that there’s always light at the end of the tunnel but usually depression does not go POOF, unfortunately. (hide spoiler)]i want to end this review by making it very clear that i am not here to shit on how haig copes with his own depression. he’s been very open about being (and having been) anxious, depressed, and suicidal, and he uses his platform to advocate for mental health -- which i think is great!it just appears the way he processes and works through his own mental health issues is very different from mine, and due to that i can safely say i did not connect to this book AT ALL. plus, i still do see some issues with representing depression as something that can be combated purely by ‘inspirational thoughts’; seeing your own potential, changing your perspective on your life, putting yourself to work so you can actually achieve something, etc. these things can be part of the solution, sure.but depression is not a series of regrets that disappears once you stop regretting. depression is a very serious illness that often requires meds as well as therapy, and is in many cases chronic as well. and i did not feel that it was treated with that level of seriousness in the book, especially considering the ending.still, i can see how this book might resonate with lots of people and inspire them to be easier on themselves and their lives. so if its premise and quotes appeal to you, don’t be afraid to pick it up.✎ 2.5 stars.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Your life is your story.

When you sit in your dark space, the droplet of another deadend life experience can send you gripping the edge and looking into the abyss. After a troubling life with repeated episodes of failures,that droplet came with the news that her long-loved cat had been hit by a car and died near the curb. Nora took to making plans. Determined plans. Plans to check out.But something will cause Nora to look beyond the mist and the fog. There\\'s an image of a tall building with classic pillars at the entrance. The fragrance of well-bound books leads her within. And there in this unusual library is the likes of the librarian, Mrs. Elm. She explains that each volume contains a different life choice for Nora. She could experience a marriage that she avoided, a missed career as a glaciologist, the professional Olympic swimming opportunity that she checked out of, and so many more regrets. Haig takes us through the options and we are intrigued for our own sake.The Midnight Library is well written and creative in its approach. Haig, himself, has suffered from depression. It brought to mind a Billy Joel song called \"You\\'re Only Human (Second Wind)\". Billy Joel wrote the song in regard to his own depression and that of a friend\\'s teenage son. It\\'s upbeat and far from preachy or maudlin. He emphasizes that we\\'re too quick to judge life in that bad moment. There\\'s a Second Wind that comes along and can move us in a completely different direction if we allow it. More than ever, during these challenging times, we\\'ve got to open our eyes mightily and search for that Second Wind. It\\'s there for the taking.A quick read packed with life lessons.

Those of us who have experienced dark moments can identify with the main character in this novel. Nora Seed has just had one of the worst days of her life. The decision she makes at the end of that day takes her to ‘The Midnight Library,’ where the librarian hands her the book of regret. It’s personalized, all the regrets that Nora has ever had are recorded in this book. This reminds me a bit of Edgar Cayce’s Akashic Records where supposedly all the information about our lives are stored, heaven’s super-computer, so to speak. Haig steps it up a bit, creating a personal library for all the possible lives we could have lived or the lives we are living in parallel universes. In the library, Nora is between life and death, like Schrödinger’s cat in the famous thought experiment. Here, she pulls books from the shelves and tries on different lives where decisions she has made have caused her to take other paths. It was easy to think of all the different paths my own life could have taken as I read about Nora’s choices. I have my own regrets and if I could have avoided even being faced with some of my choices, I would have. I’m sure other readers will have similar thoughts. How about the life that is most successful? What does that success entail? Fame, wealth, status? Or those less subtle but ultimately more meaningful markers of relationship and connectivity? Haig explores choices and regrets and a meaningful life. The narrative lagged in a few spots, but I was always interested in picking the book up and reading more. It is full of quotable passages, which is something I enjoy about Haig’s writing. For me, the following is a mind-blowing passage, especially for those times when I feel frozen. It made me think that making one more move might blow out some doors or at least open them. “Look at that chessboard we put back in place,’ said Mrs Elm softly. ‘Look at how ordered and safe and peaceful it looks now, before a game starts. It’s a beautiful thing. But it is boring. It is dead. And yet the moment you make a move on that board, things change. Things begin to get more chaotic. And that chaos builds with every single move you make.’‘It’s an easy game to play,’ she told Nora. ‘But a hard one to master. Every move you make opens a whole new world of possibilities...In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living...never underestimate the big importance of small things.” ...more Short snappy chapters that pull the reader right in to this almost ghost of Christmas past / Scrooge type setting...altho this may have something to do with the time of year I\\'m reading it 😅🎄The intro is a bit rough and may be triggering to some.

About the Book This book was a treasure for me.It took me through so many feelings and thoughts and emotions and then finally, it gave me a breath of fresh air.This book is about dealing with depression, about suicide, about hope and opportunity, about regrets and making them right, about chances and new choices but most of all, this book is about seeing. It\\'s about seeing that whatever happens, happens for a reason while also knowing it\\'s never too late to make decisions for yourself. It\\'s about stop regretting and start accepting and looking towards the light instead of looking at that endless black hole of thoughts that will do nothing except for draining your life.—This book is WAY MORE THAN just a Fantasy Book. It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.  Review It starts with Nora Seed, who feels like she\\'s not capable of doing anything right in her life. She thinks her existence means nothing and that all she has ever done is disappoint everyone. That all her choices have been a mistake and she regrets so many things that she doesn\\'t even realize when those regrets start sucking the life out of her. She thinks she has failed at the most basic of things: living.BUT right when Nora stands on that thin line between life and death, she discovers the Midnight Library.In the Midnight Library, there is a book on every single possibility in life for the person who decides to read it. There is a book on every single choice that you might have made differently. Like,—what if you missed your flight that day?—Or what if you said yes to marrying someone?—What if you didn\\'t like music?—What if you didn\\'t like swimming?You name that what-if and there would be a book about it and we all know reading a book is like a journey.So Nora travels through these books and lives through them but she can only read at midnight.And she can not read any book twice. And why would you want to when there are so many books? Of course you\\'d want to read more books instead of rereading them right away, huh?Well, after reading all these books Nora understands what she finally wants in life and which life she wants to live and it\\'s just a full of possibility.This book was very relaxing and calming for me. It was overflowing with hope and realization and positive vibes. I must say I recommend it to EVERYONE! SPOILERS AHEAD  The Best part about this Book I loved how much I could relate with Nora.I loved how inspiring and motivational this book was.I loved the perspective this book gave me and how much it helped me mentally.People often asked for fun, \"would you rather go back in time or in future\" and I always thought future. BUT, the Midnight Library made me realize how right I was to always choose it, even if that was an unconscious answer for fun.I loved knowing how amazing it is to go back in time and live life with different choices and learning how harmful regrets can be. Regrets don’t leave. They weren’t mosquito bites. They itch for ever. I loved realising that no matter what we think of our mistakes and no matter how much we dwell on the what-if\\'s and if-only\\'s, it\\'s what we do now that matters.I loved seeing that Nora Seed understood she wanted to live and make her life better and that she understood that living in the past was like living the life of a ghost and that it was the present moment that she needed to live through and make right and worth it.I\\'m very happy about the ending and Glad that she came back. I really loved the part where she was happy in her life with Ash and her daughter but I didn\\'t want her to stay there. I didn\\'t want her to abandon her REAL LIFE for it. I wanted her to make her real life THAT HAPPY and even though it\\'s not something we got to read about in the book, I hope with all my heart that she found a way to be with Ash and have a family with him and be happy and feel blessed. I\\'d like to think that she made her life better and was grateful for it. Life really is precious and it\\'s amazing how this author wrote on mental health and suicide with such a beautiful fantasy as a help.The thing is, for me, that Library is real. ‘Listen. I am part of the library. But this whole library is part of you. Do you understand? You don’t exist because of the library; this library exists because of you. Remember what Hugo said? He told you that this is the simplest way your brain translates the strange and multifarious reality of the universe. So, this is just your brain translating something. Something significant and dangerous.’ That Library is inside every one of us readers and as beautiful as the idea of it is, we should be grateful that none of us has to go visit it.We should be grateful that someone out there in the world took some time out and wrote this book and made us realize how lucky we are to sit at home and read this book without having to go through so many things.I feel like the Mrs. Elm who was the librarian inside Nora\\'s midnight library. She was not sucked into Nora\\'s lives when she read them, only Nora was. Because Nora wanted to and deeply needed to live it all and see how far she\\'s come.I know I\\'m being emotional but I\\'m very grateful this story.°*•★•*°°*•★•*°Ps: this book was nothing like the  The Starless Sea  but guess what? After reading this book, I appreciate that book a little more.

She can pick up a book that will allow her to choose a life that she could have lived, if she had taken a different path. All she has to do is grab a book. Each time Nora chooses a new life, she has no memory of her new self up until that point. She becomes a Bar Owner and Wife, a Rockstar, an Olympic Medalist, a Glaciologist, a Wife and Mother. Once she realizes that that life is not for her, she is immediately pulled from it and brought back to the library to make a new choice. In the end, Nora of course, realizes where she belongs and what is best for her. For me, what was prevalent here is the idea of that life is what you make of it and given the state of the nation, I felt truly comforted by that. “The Midnight Library” is character driven literary fiction, fantasy and science fiction all rolled into one. It is wholly satisfying and absolutely stupendous. A heartwarming read that is just what this reader was looking for!Published on Goodreads on 11.15.20. ...more Touching. Brilliant. Raw.

Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’ In a book that channels Friedrich Nietzsche, Jimmy Stewart in It\\'s A Wonderful Life, and even Doctor Who and his amazing Tardis, we get a schmaltzy feel-good life-affirming fable. Nietzsche expressed it as a question of what your response would be if a demon crept up to you and said you would live this same life innumerable times including every joy and pain, would you leap in joy or curse him to the end of eternity. Frank Capra\\'s beloved Christmas movie starring Jimmy Stewart has us thinking about what life would be like without you and the things you accomplished or the differences you made without even realizing it. Matt Haig approaches the meaning of life more like Doctor Who trapped in a Tardis with no controls where you never know where you might end up. For Nora Seed, the library between life and death is such a vehicle that allows her to travel into parallel universes where life turned out differently because she made different choices along the way. Kind of like time travel, but not cause she stays in the same time zone just in different lives. There\\'s a life where she becomes a rockstar, one where she is a scientist, one an Olympic athlete, etc, etc. just pick a different book and see where you end up.Only -- Haig\\'s library of books is like a genie\\'s three wishes. Well, you are not limited to three. There\\'s an infinite number of books. But, your wishes just may not turn out how you think. Every path traveled leads somewhere, but maybe the grass isn\\'t always greener and maybe things didn\\'t turn out how you think they would. This is not a fantasy book for those seeking knights in armor, fell dragons, or magic sorcerers. There simply may not be enough action or enough excitement for some readers. It\\'s a fable that uses the construct of an endless library to explore ideas. It\\'s cleverly done and quite an easy read. And there\\'s a sense of humor at work here cause each time Nora drops into an alternate life, she\\'s got to try and figure out her new past and how her new life works without anyone being the wiser, not even a best friend or a new husband. It\\'s quite a feat pretending to be one\\'s self when one is not altogether familiar with one\\'s new life. Many thanks to the publisher for providing a copy for review. ...more I really don\\'t know how to put into words how much I loved my first Matt Haig book, The Midnight Library.

Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library when she decides one night that she has had enough of life. She is lonely, depressed and has nothing left to live for. When she arrives into this magical place she is given and unlimited amount of chances to do things differently. Every single decision that we make in our lives, big or small, has an impact on who we are and how our live turns out. What if she had married her boyfriend? What if she had stuck with swimming? These are just some of the regrets Nora has had in her life and now she can see another path.This is a beautiful book that I could not get enough of. I was really sad when it was over. I felt a connection to Nora and was hoping that she would make the right choices. Over 2 nights I was absorbed in the world of the Midnight Library . I highly recommend you take a trip there too.Thank you to Allen and Unwin for sending me an advanced copy of this book to read. ...more Love this author and his amazing imagination!

I found it extremely boring and unoriginal. There was a movie ages ago called \"The Family Man\" with Nicolas Cage which has an incredibly similar plot. The MC wakes up and finds himself married to his long lost love and is the father to two or three children. Nora spends a good deal of the book complaining about her life. I am surprised that she didn\\'t try to bump herself off earlier if just a bad 24 hours is all that it takes to tip a person over the edge. Many people have horrible, no good, very bad days. They don\\'t jump to the conclusion that life isn\\'t worth living! Why was The Family Man better? Because it focused on one alternate life. He had built up relationships. In The Midnight Library, Nora tries on so many different lives that deep, meaningful relationships were not developed. There were some quotes in this book that I enjoyed. Also, I am absolutely obsessed with Walden by Thoreau, and he had quite a few mentions.Overall, not worth the hype, largely forgettable, and a better investment of your time and money would be to watch The Family Man. ...more I am not rating this book as I don’t feel I am the right reader for this style of fantasy.

A particularly bad day and the loss of her beloved cat Voltaire (affectionately known as Volts) has left her feeling unloved, isolated, and grasping for any sense of connection. Feeling utterly broken, Nora decides she wants to end her life and after a brief post online takes to a bottle of wine and an overdose of pills. Surprisingly, Nora wakes, finding herself in a strange and glorious library, wall-to-wall with books and her old childhood librarian Mrs. Elm helming the circulation desk. She quickly discovers that this Midnight Library is full of very \\'personalized\\' books: each book is a variation of a life she might have lived, had she only made different choices. Nora is also confronted with the Book of Regrets, summarizing all of her deepest fears and giving her the impetus she needs to select the first life she wants to explore. Mrs. Elm warns her that even the mildest disappointment with the new life selected will send her right back to the library, where she only has limited time. Armed with this advice, Nora begins her journey, rocketing from Olympic swimming glory to rock stardom, and from life as a glaciologist to barely scraping by at a low-wage job in Australia. Can she discover what will make her truly happy and bring her lasting fulfillment before the library disappears...for good?Matt Haig has absolutely done it again. The first 40% or so of this book I read in one sitting, utterly drawn in by Nora and the beautiful fantasy in this story. Haig deals with mental health struggles in such a delicate yet accessible way, giving credence to the real challenges we all face and the uncertainty and anxiety that stems from all of the \\'what ifs\\' in our lives. I knew I would love this book from the minute I first read the synopsis so many months ago, and as much as I thought I would adore it, my expectations were exceeded the entire way. Haig also spent so much time unraveling all of the layers in Nina\\'s character, by the time the book was over I was truly sad to see her go and not be a part of her world anymore. Haig also could have easily jumped to a cliche ending, but instead stayed true to life and the character, and I really appreciated that artistic choice. I absolutely loved that I left this story with so much to think about and reflect on in my own life and a new perspective on how all of the choices I\\'ve made in life have led me here: to this moment, now. An imagined future might seem shiny and spotless, but the beauty is in the life we actually make and the love we have to share. This book is beautiful, hopeful, tender, and authentic from start to finish. A tour-de-force of emotion that will stick with me for some time, and in my opinion, Haig\\'s finest work to date. 4.5 ⭐ ...more ‘Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small.

Very grateful for my friend Dave for gifting it to me! This was definitely one of those books where you feel like you picked it up at exactly the right time; a thought provoking, funny and profound read.Although the topic of the book was quite heavy, the tone of the book was uplifting and funny therefore made it a very easy read and easier to consume the topics which were being spoken about.On a personal note, it definitely served as a reflective tool for myself. I think we all from time to time picture how different our lives could’ve been had we have done things differently and taken up different opportunities. This book really solidifies the fact that there is nothing you can do about your past, but you have every chance and opportunity for your future. Your life is a continuous blank page and you can change things at any time. ‘You don’t have to understand life, you just have to live it’  – yeah, tell that to my overactive, philosophy loving, god fearing brain.

That excellent outcomes were the result of ‘the wise choice of many alternatives’. And here she was, in the privileged position of being able to sample these many alternatives.

You could open the box and see that it was alive or dead, that’s how it goes, but in one sense, even after the box is open, the cat is still both alive and dead. Every universe exists over every other universe. Like a million pictures on tracing paper, all with slight variations within the same frame. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics suggests there are an infinite number of divergent parallel universes. Every moment of your life you enter a new universe. With every decision you make. And traditionally it was thought that there could be no communication or transference between those worlds, even though they happen in the same space, even though they happen literally millimetres away from us.’ (c) Q:‘What if there are more than two roads diverging in the wood?

(c)The empowering things:Q:Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad. …it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. …But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in. (c)Q:‘You need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess,’ she said, as if Nora had nothing bigger to think about. ‘And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn’t over if there is a single pawn still on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.’ (c)Q:Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when the door closed and locked behind you.But with every life she saw that metaphorical door widen a little further as she grew better at using her imagination. (c) Q:She could have been all those amazing things, and that wasn’t depressing, as she had once thought. Not at all. It was inspiring. Because now she saw the kinds of things she could do when she put herself to work. … What sometimes feels like a trap is actually just a trick of the mind. … She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. (c)Q:We don’t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility. (c) Q:… life sometimes simply gave you a whole new perspective by waiting around long enough for you to see it. (c)Sliders are a hoot, aren\\'t they?Q:‘I’m sorry,’ his other self said, as he sipped his wine and the sun set behind him, ‘I’ve forgotten who you are.’‘Don’t worry,’ she said. ‘So have I.’ (c)Other fun stuff:Q:Ever cleaned pub toilets, Nora?’‘I’m having a pretty shit time too, if we’re doing the Misery Olympics.’ (c)Q:‘It was a lot of pressure.’‘Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’ (c) Q:Every move had been a mistake, every decision a disaster, every day a retreat from who she’d imagined she’d be. …She knew only one thing with absolute certainty: she didn’t want to reach tomorrow. (c)Q:‘You don’t go to death. Death comes to you.’Even death was something Nora couldn’t do properly, it seemed. (c) Q:Did you do anything wrong?’That was an easy one. ‘Yes. Absolutely everything.’ (c)Q:… while most people were into rock music you were into actual rocks and stuff.’ (c)Q:You have yourself in quite high esteem there, Nora.’‘Shouldn’t I? I mean, shouldn’t everyone? What’s wrong with self-esteem? (c) Q:I have carefully calculated that the pain of me living as the bloody disaster that is myself is greater than the pain anyone else will feel if I were to die. In fact, I’m sure it would be a relief. (c) Q:She wondered how many Dans there were in the world, dreaming of things they would hate if they actually got them. And how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness? (c) Q:‘Interesting. I had no idea there was such a thing as between-life snobbery. You are an education.’ (c) Q:To be a human was to continually dumb the world down into an understandable story that keeps things simple. (c) Q:‘I have been so many things. On every continent on Earth. And yet I have never found the life for me. I am resigned to being this way for ever. There will never be a life that I truly want to live for ever. I get too curious. I get too much of a yearning to live another way. And you don’t need to make that face. It’s not sad. I am happily in limbo.’…I kind of like being a slider. I like imperfection. I like keeping death as an option. I like never having to settle.’ … You do realise there are infinite possibilities here? I mean, the multiverse isn’t about just some universes. It’s not about a handful of universes. It’s not even about a lot of universes. It’s not about a million or a billion or a trillion universes. It’s about an infinite number of universes. Even with you in them. You could be you in any version of the world, however unlikely that world would be. You are only limited by your imagination. You can be very creative with the regrets you want to undo. I once undid a regret about not doing something I’d contemplated as a teenager – doing aerospace engineering and becoming an astronaut – and so in one life I became an astronaut. I haven’t been to space. But I became someone who had been there, for a little while. The thing you have to remember is that this is an opportunity and it is rare and we can undo any mistake we made, live any life we want. Any life. Dream big .\\xa0.\\xa0.

(c) Q:You coughed your guts out and had hypothermia but you crossed the river, against incredible odds. You found something inside you.’‘Yes. Bacteria. I was ill for weeks. I swallowed so much of that shitty water.’ (c) Q:‘It’s an easy game to play,’ she told Nora. ‘But a hard one to master. Every move you make opens a whole new world of possibility.’ … In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living.’ (c)Q:He seemed like he would be able to sit in a field near Chernobyl and marvel at the beautiful scenery. (c) Q:She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality.

You might rather be a sort of nothing.“Nora stared down at the small mole on her left hand. That mole had been through everything she’d been through. And it just stayed there, not caring. Just being a mole.”Well, Matt Haig has some surprises in store for you . . . and your mole!But a warning – watch out for the wine and any other bad choices that could send you loopy. Hang on, things are going to get hairy! Remember your favourite librarian, Mrs. Elm? Guess what? She’s still a librarian, and you, lucky you, are about to see her again. “As she spoke, Mrs. Elm’s eyes came alive, twinkling puddles in moonlight.‘Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices.’”Turns out, you have/had an infinite number of choices, Nora. Mrs. Elm will tell you about the Robert Frost poem.“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I – I took the road less travelled by, And that has made all the difference . . .” But then she asks you, what if there were more than two roads, an endless number of roads? What would Frost have done? What would YOU do?Isn\\'t it nice that Mrs. Elm is named for a tree? A tree that has, well maybe not an infinite number of branches, but a lot.Now guess what? Mrs. Elm is going to show you an infinite number of shelves, climbing out of sight into the heavens, filled with your books, your life choices. Go ahead, be brave. Pick one and dive in! Who knows?NORA dives in. This is fun, a bit preachy and a bit expected, but entertaining. It reminds me of the old Quantum Leap show where the hero suddenly landed somewhere in time to sort things out. Nora does much the same, seeing her life and the people in it from different perspectives. If her life changes, so does theirs. I’ll quote from only one. No, two, because I liked the title of this chapter.“Why Want Another Universe If This One Has Dogs?””Below is a favourite ‘landing’, but it’s not a spoiler.“But since entering the Midnight Library Nora had slowly got used to the peculiar.. . . She felt her ring finger.Two rings.The man turned over.An arm landed across her in the dark and she gently raised it and placed it back on the duvet.”Although the message isn’t new, and many of the situations seem a little obvious, it is an entertaining read that I hope might help pull a few people back from the brink, stop them from living and dying and measuring success by social media and dwelling on bitter regrets. Sometimes what seems obvious to me, isn’t obvious or believable when you’re in the depths of despair. ...more ★ ★ ★ ½, rounded up because I finished the book smilingI started The Midnight Library and was groaning, \"Ugh.

I will say Nora is definitely not your typical person, she has a LOT of variety in her lives - I suspect that my own lives would all just be slightly different shades of the same color compared to Nora\\'s rainbow spectrum of lives. I really enjoyed this part of the book though as we got to see how decisions led to radically different outcomes. The last life in particular gave me great joy and I was hoping the story would kind of end there, but instead we get this great big metaphor represented in physical form in the story and an ending that left me unhappy with how trite it felt.

I flew through this book. This was a beautiful story about regrets and not living your life based on others expectations. Maybe the things that you often regret in life are not actually the things that you should regret. There are so many other possibilities of how your life could have gone differently based on every single choice you make, that who knows if making that one seemingly better decision would have turned out any better. Nobody is happy all of the time. No matter what decisions you make in life, there will always be good times and bad times. When things are bad, it is not just your shitty life, it is life. Sounds a bit cynical but it is true, no matter what decisions you make in life it will never be good times 100 percent of the time, so there is no use in wallowing in the past. Keep moving past and the good times will come. Definitely recommend this book. I think that even the non sci-fi lovers out there would enjoy it. ...more I don’t read many books that include a fantasy theme, but when I read the blurb for The Midnight Library, I knew I had to read it.

This brilliant author is ever so able to handle the topic covered in this amazing book that sheds light on depression and the choices we not only make or possibly could have made in our life.Welcome to the midnight library, a place that exists in the world between life and death, where our decisions and the paths we chose not to take are explored . Would there have been a better outcome, a happier road, a brilliant future if only we had chosen one tiny different decision? Meet Nora Seed, a young woman on the brink of ending her life. She is feeling useless, depressed, despondent, morose with the thought that she needed all of this to be over. For Nora, life is no longer worth living, no longer valuable, no longer a place she wants to be. Never thinking of the existence of a library that holds every alternative path your life could have taken, she enters the midnight library where directed by a librarian she once loved and admired, Nora takes a journey down many roads not traveled to see the various ways life could have been different. Her odysseys into the \"what if\" are all varied, carrying her into the worlds she could have chosen from being an Olympic swimmer, to a glaciologist, finding love with different people, or even finding that all these choices still might not make her ultimately happy. Is her life truly doomed or is there a shred of hope that there is something, anything that really makes the life she was given worth staying around for?This thought provoking novel is intense, bringing to the forefront so many things all of us have pondered, our own \"what ifs\" of life. I particularly was drawn to the wonderful analogy Mr Haig made of life being like a chess game. Nothing changes until we make a move on the board and that move might be made in hundreds of different ways making hundreds of different happenings occur. How ultimately true how all our lives and that of our main protagonist can change with a split second decision or one that took years to form. At a time like now, where we see so much doom and gloom and where suicides are rising at such an alarming rate, this book\\'s importance are magnified. I certainly recommend this one as Mr Haig is quickly becoming a go to author for me.Thank you to Matt Haig for opening me up to a topic I find ever so fascinating, to Canongate Books and to Edelweiss for an advanced copy of this tragic yet life affirming story due out on August 13, 2020.Jan and I were ever so happy to learn that Matt Haig had written a new book.

I woke up this morning and started it again, and finished it in between the avalanche of meetings I have had today. I decided to post my probably going to be a scattered review since I want to just get over this book as quickly as possible. First off, Matt Haig probably without meaning to just gave a big old middle finger to people who suffer from depression and those of us still here, who have thought about committing suicide. Most of this book seems to be saying depressions is just really about regrets humans have and hey what if we made a fantastical space between death and lie and you get a chance to live every life you possibly can so that way you can see how important you are and that suicide is not the way to go. \"The Midnight Library\" follows 35 year old Nora Seed who is having a very bad day/life. Nora is stuck in a dead end job at a music store and gets sacked. Her piano student no longer needs her. A friendly guy she knows from her job finds her cat dead in the road. And when Nora finds out her brother Joe has been in town and not met up with her, she realizes he still holds a grudge against her for not fulfilling his dream of being rock stars (it\\'s a long part of the story I refuse to relive). The book starts a countdown to when Nora will take her life. Then Nora \"wakes up\" in a place called \"The Midnight Library\" where time has stopped at 00:00 and the librarian from her childhood is there to guide Nora and show her all of her regrets and the many books(lives) she can live. We follow Nora as she gets to know more about the library, the many lives she could have lived, and the regrets she has around her parents, her best friend Izzy, her ex fiancée (who is a tool) and her brother Joe. First, depression is serious. Depression is a liar. The main character in this book, Nora, suffers from depression, but besides Haig talking about her pills and that, we don\\'t get any sense that Nora has tried to see a therapist. There\\'s a lot that has happened to her and based on her family history that is revealed, it sounds like Nora\\'s mother suffer from depression and addiction issues, and we definitely know her brother does as well. I don\\'t know. Maybe as someone who has suffered from depression I was hoping for a book that would explore that, and explore how that feels to the person in the middle of it. If Haig had shown any of Nora\\'s lives with her getting more of a understanding besides hey apparently with no regrets things are great, and you should hold onto the life you have, because other lives may suck, I would have applauded this book.Second, the character development of several people is not there because we skip around with Nora into the many lives she gets to explore. We start to see along with her that maybe her father was a terrible damn person, that her brother was blaming her for things beyond her control, etc. but I don\\'t know. It just felt surface level deep. The writing at times gets very repetitive and I hope you like reading the words \"root life\" because it appears a lot. I think the worst sections for me were when Nora did that stupid TED talk and made me want to scream and when she went off to be an glaciest (or whatever the word is for people who study glaciers) and pretty much met a dude who stole the idea behind what is happening to her from a tv show that I haven\\'t thought about in years. The poems that pop up throughout also made me hard cringe, but many readers who have followed my reviews know how I feel about bad poetry. The flow is pretty bad. I think the chapter that was the worse is when we are walked through all of Nora\\'s lives and I just did not care.The setting of the book changes a few times and I will give Haig credit. He can set a scene. It was interesting to see Nora in so many different places, countries, and going through so many experiences, he can capture the mood. The ending is pretty lackluster I thought. And honestly that was actually okay. I just maybe sighed that there is no follow-up or seemingly anything that is going to happen with Nora getting the care she needs. Apparently her \"Midnight Library\" was enough.  ...more ARC received in exchange for an honest review. Sometimes you find a book, a really rare book, that speaks to you on a deeply personal level. The Midnight Library is that book for me. Given the opportunity, would you go back and follow a different path? Would you take up the chance to follow a different life by changing just one decision? That\\'s the chance Nora faces in the Midnight Library. Caught somewhere between life and death, she must face all of her fears and decisions.

That\\'s the chance Nora faces in the Midnight Library. Caught somewhere between life and death, she must face all of her fears and decisions. It\\'s a story of regrets, anxiety, loss and grief. But it might also just be about hope too. Matt Haig\\'s battle with his own mental health has been well publicised by Matt himself, and you can see a lot of his own personal struggles within Nora. It\\'s what makes her so real and relatable. At the start of the novel she\\'s struggling tremendously with her mental health. In a dark hole of depression, she\\'s struggling to get to grips with how exhausting her life is. She has no hope left, nothing to fight for. And in that moment she makes a decision, possibly her final decision, which leads her to the library. I\\'ve never fried so much as I did following Nora\\'s story. Seeing her dreams, her changing ambitions, all while still struggling with anxiety and depression. I felt so seen as an ownvoices reader. Nora is a reflection of myself, even down to the same medications, and we both have similar thoughts of anxiety and regret. At times she\\'s so fragile, so exposed to a world that isn\\'t ready for her, and I felt every cautious comment and surge of hope alongside her. She\\'s perhaps the most carefully developed and complicated character I\\'ve ever read. The secondary characters, even down to Volts the cat, share this complexity and only add to the deep well of emotions at play here. The story itself is built around Nora, and grows organically as she does. Her journeys to different lives become more strange and extreme as Nora changes, and with each life we learn something new about her. I think my favourite life is her time spent with an equally mysterious traveller in a chilly climate - who opens up Nora to a completely different way of experiencing life. That said, every experience Nora has feels important and relevant to the plot. No sentence is wasted in showing us Nora\\'s worlds and the potential she has. It\\'s a potential we all have, but it can be difficult to find when were cut down by inner thoughts and demons. I don\\'t think I could profess enough about how much I love this book.

A love story with self. A cascade of calm.The Midnight Library, at its core, is a testament to the inherent goodness in every life; only, it is narrated in a fantastical way, a way beyond life and little short of death, because unless we are shown something otherworldly, we don’t appreciate the commonplace. Just like Nora. Until she became privy to multiple lives – that of an Olympian Swimmer and a Rockstar, a Glaciologist and an Academician – she didn’t comprehend what lay sealed in the recesses of her heart. A mute, expectant love, waiting to spread wings and overwhelm Nora’s being.  And when she thought of her root life, the fundamental problem with it, the thing that had left her vulnerable, really, was the absence of love.  The Midnight Library and its librarian, the endearing and wise, Mrs. Elm, provided Nora a chance to relive a life she was (nearly) done with; a cycle that she had the power to manoeuvre in any direction she wished. And chances she did take. Hopping into multiple bodies and slipping into different emotions made her more conscious of what she had left behind, like succumbing to an acute yearning for home when one is travelling, even conquering, the world.  A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.  And worthwhile it was. To know that I was capable. To know that fumbles are normal. To know that deluges pass too. To know that friends are just a word away. To know that the whole city of life is dotted with trees of kindness that pop up at every corner to provide shade even when I am not looking for them. This library. Especially in these times.

The straw that broke the camel’s back is when her beloved feline, Volts, dies. She previously lost her job at a music store, her brother hates her, and she’s lost touch with her BFF. She’s just fed up with life; she’s full of despair. As the story begins, she takes all her anti-depressants…. but wakes up!In a weird Library with what appears to be millions of books in copious amounts of bookshelves that seem to go on forever. She finds her primary school librarian, Mrs. Elm. Mrs. Elm explains to Nora and the reader that Nora is very lucky, and she’s given the chance to do some “do-overs” in her life. Nora is overwhelmed with this idea, and Mrs. Elm starts with “The book of regrets”. Author Matt Haig’s new novel ponders the idea of parallel universes and quantum physics. This is a meditation on the millions of different choices we all make in our lives that make the events of our lives occur. Say, instead of going to work, you chose to take the day off and go to the beach. There is a universe where one of you went to the beach and one of you went to work, with different life outcomes occurring. In the Midnight Library, Nora can pick a time and do her life differently. So in this magical moment, when Nora is not alive and not dead, in her case it’s midnight, she is in a suspended place where she can review where her life went wrong or what she could have done differently.She’s encouraged by Mrs. Elm to sample different lives. To go into them and see if they felt more authentic or were what she wanted out of life. Interestingly, there are the same characters in many of her lives. But the character’s fortunes are sometime different. In one her brother is dead; another he’s successful. In one her mother is dead, and in another she’s alive. It’s similar to “It’s a Wonderful Life” in that she does see the value she adds to others in some of her lives.I enjoyed the idea of the novel. I liked that it made me think about what my “book of regrets” could be. It was a refreshing look at how others are responsible for their own lives. And, there is a bit of fate in it: no matter what you did, X occurred. And I have thought about parallel universes and what a different “me” could be doing right now. Given our turbulent reality with the virus and political divisiveness, this was a refreshing read. ...more 5 stars for the concept.3 stars for the development.Brief published in the NY Times: “Nora Seeds finds a library beyond the edge of the universe that contains books with multiple possibilities of the lives one could have lived.”Isn’t that a terrific premise?I loved the concept.

I was in a crunch for time, so I listened to the audio, and Carey Mulligan has easily made it onto the list of one of my favorite narrators, just with this book! She was the absolute perfect Nora, and I loved the fact she was so easy to understand even with her accent. Now I just need her to narrate more books!The Midnight Library is an enchanting, and sometimes sad, story about a woman who has decided she wants to die only to end up in the Midnight Library with her old school librarian, Mrs. Elm. Here she gets the opportunity to experience other possibilities in other lives she could have had, to figure out if she actually wants to be dead or if life is worth continuing to be lived. Clearly that in itself is heartbreaking, but her journey as she tours pieces of these other lives was thought-provoking, unique, and makes us as the reader appreciate the life we have. This book could have been depressing and awful, but instead it is a masterpiece that deserves to be read by everyone.I read The Midnight Library as part of a group/buddy read and I think it will make for a wonderful discussion so I could easily see it being a great choice for book clubs. I loved Nora and many of the other characters, and even though it is a short book it really packs an emotional punch. It was also a very quick read so you could easily read this in one sitting. The Midnight Library is definitely going to make my list of top books for the year, and I highly recommend it if you are a fan of magical realism and books that make you think. ...more Inspiring, devastating, beautiful and eye-opening, The Midnight Library is a magical ride through a life as worth living as any other that one could imagine.

What an enlightening discussion.She\\'s a philosopher to the boot:Q:‘Go confidently in the direction of your dreams,’ Thoreau had said. ‘Live the life you’ve imagined.’Thoreau had been her favourite philosopher to study. But who seriously goes confidently in the direction of their dreams? Well, apart from Thoreau. He’d gone and lived in the woods, with no contact from the outside world, to just sit there and write and chop wood and fish. (c) Q:At university she had done an essay drily titled ‘The Principles of Hobbesian Memory and Imagination’. Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing, and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories. (c) Q:She remembered studying Aristotle as a first-year Philosophy student. And being a bit depressed by his idea that excellence was never an accident. That excellent outcomes were the result of ‘the wise choice of many alternatives’. And here she was, in the privileged position of being able to sample these many alternatives. It was a shortcut to wisdom and maybe a shortcut to happiness too. She saw it now not as a burden but a gift to be cherished. (c) Q:‘Life begins,’ Sartre once wrote, ‘on the other side of despair.’ (c)She\\'s also a Q: Swimmer. Musician. Philosopher. Spouse. Traveller. Glaciologist. Happy. Loved. (c) All failed.

Her old librarian, Mrs Elm, is charoning her around. (I do think that Mrs Elm is just a figment of Nora\\'s imagination, a brain trying to explain things in user-friendly terms and to introduce something known into the vastness of unknown between lives or even worlds. Hugo insisted that Mrs Elm and Philippe are interpretations.). Q:I see a simplified version of the truth. The librarian is just a kind of mental metaphor. The whole thing is.

Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’ (c) Q:‘Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations. These books are portals to all the lives you could be living.’ (c)Q:‘Librarians have knowledge. They guide you to the right books. The right worlds. They find the best places. Like soul-enhanced search engines.’ (c)The quantum discussion (where would we be without it?):Q:‘Erwin Schrödinger .\\xa0.\\xa0.’‘He of the cat.’‘Yes. The cat guy. He said that in quantum physics every alternative possibility happens simultaneously. All at once. In the same place. Quantum superposition. The cat in the box is both alive and dead. You could open the box and see that it was alive or dead, that’s how it goes, but in one sense, even after the box is open, the cat is still both alive and dead. Every universe exists over every other universe. Like a million pictures on tracing paper, all with slight variations within the same frame. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics suggests there are an infinite number of divergent parallel universes. Every moment of your life you enter a new universe. With every decision you make. And traditionally it was thought that there could be no communication or transference between those worlds, even though they happen in the same space, even though they happen literally millimetres away from us.’ (c) Q:‘What if there are more than two roads diverging in the wood? What if there are more roads than trees? What if there is no end to the choices you could make? What would Robert Frost do then?’ (c) Q:She learned that undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true. There was almost any life she was living in one universe, after all. (c)Q:Going for a coffee with Ash might have led, for instance, to Nora falling in love with the person serving the coffee. That was simply the unpredictable nature of quantum physics. (c)The empowering things:Q:Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad. …it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. …But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in. (c)Q:‘You need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess,’ she said, as if Nora had nothing bigger to think about. ‘And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn’t over if there is a single pawn still on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.’ (c)Q:Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when the door closed and locked behind you.But with every life she saw that metaphorical door widen a little further as she grew better at using her imagination. (c) Q:She could have been all those amazing things, and that wasn’t depressing, as she had once thought. Not at all. It was inspiring. Because now she saw the kinds of things she could do when she put herself to work. … What sometimes feels like a trap is actually just a trick of the mind. … She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. (c)Q:We don’t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility. (c) Q:… life sometimes simply gave you a whole new perspective by waiting around long enough for you to see it. (c)Sliders are a hoot, aren\\'t they?Q:‘I’m sorry,’ his other self said, as he sipped his wine and the sun set behind him, ‘I’ve forgotten who you are.’‘Don’t worry,’ she said. ‘So have I.’ (c)Other fun stuff:Q:Ever cleaned pub toilets, Nora?’‘I’m having a pretty shit time too, if we’re doing the Misery Olympics.’ (c)Q:‘It was a lot of pressure.’‘Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’ (c) Q:Every move had been a mistake, every decision a disaster, every day a retreat from who she’d imagined she’d be. …She knew only one thing with absolute certainty: she didn’t want to reach tomorrow. (c)Q:‘You don’t go to death. Death comes to you.’Even death was something Nora couldn’t do properly, it seemed. (c) Q:Did you do anything wrong?’That was an easy one. ‘Yes. Absolutely everything.’ (c)Q:… while most people were into rock music you were into actual rocks and stuff.’ (c)Q:You have yourself in quite high esteem there, Nora.’‘Shouldn’t I? I mean, shouldn’t everyone? What’s wrong with self-esteem? (c) Q:I have carefully calculated that the pain of me living as the bloody disaster that is myself is greater than the pain anyone else will feel if I were to die. In fact, I’m sure it would be a relief. (c) Q:She wondered how many Dans there were in the world, dreaming of things they would hate if they actually got them. And how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness? (c) Q:‘Interesting. I had no idea there was such a thing as between-life snobbery. You are an education.’ (c) Q:To be a human was to continually dumb the world down into an understandable story that keeps things simple. (c) Q:‘I have been so many things. On every continent on Earth. And yet I have never found the life for me. I am resigned to being this way for ever. There will never be a life that I truly want to live for ever. I get too curious. I get too much of a yearning to live another way. And you don’t need to make that face. It’s not sad. I am happily in limbo.’…I kind of like being a slider. I like imperfection. I like keeping death as an option. I like never having to settle.’ … You do realise there are infinite possibilities here? I mean, the multiverse isn’t about just some universes. It’s not about a handful of universes. It’s not even about a lot of universes. It’s not about a million or a billion or a trillion universes. It’s about an infinite number of universes. Even with you in them. You could be you in any version of the world, however unlikely that world would be. You are only limited by your imagination. You can be very creative with the regrets you want to undo. I once undid a regret about not doing something I’d contemplated as a teenager – doing aerospace engineering and becoming an astronaut – and so in one life I became an astronaut. I haven’t been to space. But I became someone who had been there, for a little while. The thing you have to remember is that this is an opportunity and it is rare and we can undo any mistake we made, live any life we want. Any life. Dream big .\\xa0.\\xa0. You can be anything you want to be. Because in one life, you are.’ (c) Q:It seems that you have spent all your life saying things that you aren’t really thinking. … The regrets she had been living with most of her life were wasted ones. (c) Q:You coughed your guts out and had hypothermia but you crossed the river, against incredible odds. You found something inside you.’‘Yes. Bacteria. I was ill for weeks. I swallowed so much of that shitty water.’ (c) Q:‘It’s an easy game to play,’ she told Nora. ‘But a hard one to master. Every move you make opens a whole new world of possibility.’ … In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living.’ (c)Q:He seemed like he would be able to sit in a field near Chernobyl and marvel at the beautiful scenery. (c) Q:She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality.

When I read his books, I feel SEEN. Like, someone gets me. Like I\\'m not alone. I don\\'t even know what to say. This was just absolutely extraordinary and spoke to me on such a deep level. I remember a time when I didn\\'t want to live either, and wow if I had read this back then, it would have meant everything to me (let\\'s be real, it still means everything to me.) The parts about motherhood especially touched me, there\\'s truly no other love like it. It was also just so fun to read about all her other potential lives, I couldn\\'t put it down! It was just so interesting while also pulling on my heartstrings, for sure! trigger warnings: death of a pet, suicide and suicide ideation, loss of a parent (cancer), loss of a parent (heart attack), cheating, drug use, loss of sibling (overdose).  ...more CW for suicidal ideationNora Seed decides to die but wakes up in a strange library where she can try out \"books\" of her life, all the roads not taken.

The Midnight Library by Matt Haig is one of those books, and when it became available through the NY Public Library (I\\'d been on a waiting list for months) last week, I accepted the offer and dived in that night. For the most part, it\\'s a contemporary fiction novel in which a character explores the different roads she could\\'ve taken had she made alternative decisions. While it\\'s deemed part fantasy/sci-fi, it\\'s really not... this is more about the emotional connections and understandings of a young woman who\\'s considering suicide as a way to end her pain.Nora Seed was once a competitive swimmer but gave it up. She had love in parts of her life, but lost it. She had friends and a good life but walked away. She had a bad relationship with her family but tried to mend it. Everything she attempted seemed to fail, and one day, she decides life isn\\'t right for her. When she passes over to an unknown place, Nora learns she hasn\\'t quite died yet. It\\'s midnight, and she has an opportunity to look at different lives she could\\'ve had... except there\\'s a twist -- it\\'s through books with a familiar librarian. She might only have enough time to see one or it could be thousands. And if she dies in one of those lives in the moment she chooses to witness, her life is definitely over. So much to consider here... and I really enjoyed all her exploration.I\\'m not gonna comment in detail on the way suicide is handled in this book. I know it\\'s bugged some readers, and perhaps it\\'s viewed as sharing the wrong messages. I don\\'t think that\\'s at all an easy topic and there will always be tons of opinions. To me, this is purely one person\\'s experience, and I respect the way the story is told. There are reasons why it works; there are reasons why it\\'s too fluffy. But the key for me is the trajectory of Nora\\'s emotions as she visits each life. I adored the movie \\'Defending Your Life\\' for the same reasons as I very much connected with this book. The ability to discover what happens in your own life when you\\'re not looking closely enough is sheer beauty.I think this will work even better as a movie, as the visual effects of the library and its destruction will be amazing. Having a few key character relationships will tug at our hearts. I would definitely read more by this author. I recommend this for readers who enjoy time travel (but not purely for the scientific aspects of it) and who aren\\'t triggered by anything related to suicide or thoughts of harming oneself. Those items withstanding, it\\'s compelling and rich with thought-provoking concepts. ...more Inbetween life and death lies the Midnight Library.

Nora was an individual suffering under tough mental strain, struggling with finding her place in the world, and seemingly unable to muster any good thoughts, which resulted in her depressive state leeching out onto the page and making this a book I had to consume in small increments. This is a testament to Haig\\'s writing, that I felt I could so closely resemble Nora and feel her emotions as my own, but is something to be wary of when going in.Her exploration of the limitless lives quickly transformed these early emotions into ones far more convoluted. As Nora started to find her true self this early sadness did not dissipate, but it became mixed with every other spectrum of emotion a human can feel. It opened up hope, alongside anger, and grief, mingled with moments of happiness. Haig showed us, in just a few pages, again and again, what it is to be alive.Haig\\'s acute observations into the nature of mental health and the internal struggles many of us feel lead this to be a thoughtful and sensitive read, but it also becomes one which increasingly let the sunshine in, leaving me in floods of happy tears at the close of it. ...more I\\'m uncertain as to what exactly I expected from this book, but certainly more than what I received in turn, given that it won the Goodreads Choice Award for Fiction in 2020.

Of course, the story is based on a good premise, and I can understand why many readers found it inspirational. But it somehow didn\\'t have the same magic on me.The story is simply about a woman (Nora Seed) who struggles with life and who is full of past regrets. She is tired of her fight to live and wishes to end it. But, she is offered a fantastic opportunity to live the lives she would have, had she made her life choices differently, through books in a midnight library. It is a pretty predictable story. We understand what the author is driving at; that is to say that the life you lead is the best possible life you can have and that it is the choices you make in life that define you and not your success. The premise is really good and it is the kind of book that I would have embraced. But for some queer reason, I couldn\\'t fully connect with the story. It was sheer torture to get through some of the chapters. And I considered giving it up a few times. But overall, I\\'m glad that I persevered, for the author pulled some timely strings towards the end to steer the story on to a better and more enjoyable ground. The writing wasn\\'t impressive. There were so many repetitive phrases that, at times, I could form what Nora is about to say before reading the written dialogue. I find that kind of writing quite tiresome. The author has thrown Thoreau\\'s philosophical quotes lavishly to add weight, but, except for a desire to revisit Thoreau\\'s Walden, most of them lost their contextual significance on me. All considered, it wasn\\'t an easy reading journey for me. Although I ended up enjoying the final chapters, I struggled a lot in the middle. Rating the book wasn\\'t easy either. I was greatly undecided till the very last chapter. However, for choosing a good and somewhat difficult premise and working a story on that, and trying his best to convey a timely and powerful message to the world when it is in dire need to hear it, I decided on a rounded three stars, keeping my personal perspectives at bay. ...more A poignant, intriguing and thought-provoking book of self-discovery.SUMMARYHave you ever been to the Midnight Library?

She no longer wants to live. And it is then that she finds herself in the Midnight Library. She now has a chance to perhaps find, and even live, a better life.The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora to drop in on her alternate lives had she made different decisions. She can now undo every one of her regrets and missed opportunities as she tries to find her perfect life. But what exactly does a perfect life look like. Things aren’t exactly what Nora imagined they’d be when different decisions are made. “If you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. Aim to be you. Aim to look and act and think like you and to be the truest version of you. Embrace that you-ness. Endorse it. Love it. Work hard at it. And don’t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it. Most gossip is envy in disguise.”REVIEWThe Midnight Library is a unique, inventive and thought-provoking story. Have you ever asked yourself, “what if I had done this or that differently, I wonder...?” That’s exactly what Nora gets to see. But first Nora has to get over her regrets before she can even imagine a different life. It is unsettling and painful to watch Nora’s downward spiral but interesting to watch her try to figure out her life, and who she wants to be. The Midnight Library is a poignant, intriguing and thought-provoking book. And to top it off it’s set in a library! And who of us does not love not a library. The Midnight Library serves as a great reminder that no one has a perfect life. There will be disappointments, and bad things are going to happen, but it is also possible there will also be joy and happiness just around the next corner. It is what we do in the face of adversity that defines us. The Midnight Library was written by Matt Haig who has suffered from depression and thoughts of suicide. In 2015, Haig wrote the bestselling book Reasons to Stay Alive after walking away from a suicide attempt sixteen years earlier. His writing is definitely informed, and highly readable. I listen to an audio version of the book and appreciated the performance. “We only need to be one person. We only need to feel one existence.

But between life and death, there is a library. A library with shelves that go on forever, books full of the infinite possibilities of her life. And a librarian she recognizes who is ready to lead the way.As someone who has suffered from depression and loved people whose lives have been touched by suicide, the Midnight Library hit very close to home. I, too, have a book of regrets. Choices I wish I could undo. Lives I wish I could have lived. While I am lucky enough to have carved out a happy life where I feel loved and valued, not everyone is so fortunate. If my twenties had progressed differently, I could very well have ended up in a very similar situation to Nora, and I could relate to her on a visceral level.This book explores a difficult topic with clarity and hope, and leaves the reader with nugget after nugget of wisdom to digest. Questioning the nature of memory, challenging our expectations, interrogating our definition of a \"good\" or \"purposeful\" life, and reminding us that fulfilling our dreams is never a one-way ticket to everlasting happiness, Haig reminds us that the grass isn\\'t always greener and that sometimes all we need is a slight shift in perspective.Beautifully crafted, touching, and inspiring, The Midnight Library is well worth your time.VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/ERIVDkarlUYYou can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | Twitter*PBB Book Club Selection for January 2021* ...more OMG!!!!

In many instances in our lives, the Infinite number of \"could have beens\" must\\'ve crossed our minds.You pick a choice among many, one out of millions of choices, yet the restlessness that gnaws at you pushes you to believe that there could have been a better choice that led to a better outcome.We always believe that the choices and decisions we make will always have better alternatives and it kills us because we are always haunted by it! In this story, we follow Nora Seed, a woman haunted by past mistakes and ridden with regrets. She believes that her life is destined to be miserable. Somehow, she holds on to the last thread connecting her to life but rather than find herself in oblivion, she is transported to a mysterious terrain with a building in the size of the church perched in the middle of it. Imagine if you found shelves full of books that tell the story of the lives you could have lived. The chance to experience each life you could\\'ve had; the one where you have picked what you thought was the better choice, or the one where you picked a different occupation, or the one you where you had become a happier person. That is the magic of the Midnight Library.Along with the heroine, we discover the vastness of life and its endless possibilities.It\\'s a book that prompts us to reflect on our life and gives us a different lens to help us have a better look at the choices we make and how we view them.What is inevitable, you have no choice in changing it, and that is a difficult pill to swallow.You didn\\'t have to enjoy every aspect of each life to keep having the option of experiencing them. You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed. Equally, enjoying a life didn\\'t mean you stayed in that life. You only stayed in a life forever if you couldn\\'t imagine a better one, and yet, paradoxically, the more lives you\\'ve tried the easier it became to think of something better, as the imagination broadened a bit more with every new life she sampled.It\\'s a contemporary that coexists in a fantastical setting and it is tinted with a philosophical undertone that indirectly delivers the life lessons the author sought to gift the reader.Fortunately, the author managed to keep the story at good pacing with its poetic flow while smoothly weaving the important themes into the story without making the dialogue heavy nor dragging the progression of the story.It is a story that touched my sentiments because I\\'ve often been a person that drowned in my misery. This book felt like a soft breeze that gently caressed my soul.We only need to be one person.We only need to feel one existence.We don\\'t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility.Trigger Warning: mentions of suicide, death, depression and grief. ...more ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’Fascinating!

I’ve never read anything by Haig before this book, but I can guarantee that this oversight will be addressed. Because The Midnight Library was wonderful. There’s incredible philosophical depth packed into relatively few pages. And for a book that begins with a suicide attempt, it ended up being surprisingly positive and uplifting. Not only is it a thoughtful novel, it inspired deep contemplation within the reader, but in a way that is comfortingly gentle for the times in which we’re living.“Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when was the door closed and locked behind you.” Nora Seed doesn’t matter. Not to any single person on the face of the earth. At least, that’s what she thinks. When this belief leads her to the decision to end her own life, she finds herself caught between life and death in the Midnight Library. This library contains every single life she could have possibly led had she made even the slightest of different decisions. If she can find the perfect life among the stacks before midnight ends, she can keep it. But if she’s still undecided when the clock begins to tick once more, the Midnight Library will burn to ash, taking every perspective life, and Nora herself, along with it.“The thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory.”I loved accompanying Nora on each of her journeys. Not so much because they were adventures, though some of them were, but because I really enjoyed witnessing her growth. As she tackled her regrets, she slowly and sometimes painfully changed both her worldview and her opinion of herself and her worth. It was such an encouraging transformation, and reminded me more than a little of It’s a Wonderful Life. She\\'s more important than she knows, and every decision she\\'s ever made has rippled out to touch others. “And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.” If given the same opportunity Nora has, would you try on different lives in hopes of finally finding one that fits? My knee-jerk response would be a unequivocal yes. But upon further reflection, I don’t think I would actually take that plunge. While I might not be the rock star or author or professor I dreamed of becoming as a child, those possibilities still live within me, and will until I draw my final breath. What I wouldn’t change for the world are the relationships I have. I’ve been blessed with an insanely fun marriage to my best friend, a tight-knit family, and some wonderful friendships. Any different path I might have taken could have radically altered any of those relationships. I honestly believe that it wouldn’t be worth the risk. Instead, I can take those relationships and the potential I know lives within me and make more of an effort to make one or more of my own dreams come true. The worst that could happen is that I fail and end up back where I started. What would I have lost? Absolutely nothing but the fear that kept me from trying in the first place, the loss of which would actually be worth failing in order to attain.“Sometimes just to say your own truth out loud is enough to find others like you.”Any work of fiction that can move its readers to reevaluate their own lives and try a little harder has accomplished something incredible. And if the book can do so in a way that is gentle and comforting instead of shaming in any way, that’s truly something special. Matt Haig gives us something that special with The Midnight Library. I can see this being a book I reread whenever life starts feeling like it isn’t worth the trouble. The Midnight Library is hope and potential and solace all packed into one slim book. Read it. Press it into the hands of anyone you know that might be struggling.

It started off holding my attention and keeping me thoroughly interested but somewhere around the middle, things started falling flat. I was curious to read about such a tough topic and how the author was going to go about said topic. I loved the idea of it. The message is great in some ways! Essentially, stop thinking: ‘It would have been better if...’. Suicide is definitely a tricky topic to address especially with the potential for triggering readers and I applaud the author on having the courage to write about such topics. Here’s what bugged me...Why is it that no matter what the main character did she was always a professional? The list goes on! Not once did it say that she tried something and failed. Everything was Olympian, Glaciologist in National Geographic, incredibly successful singer in a band, and later in the book as it talks about her different lives she lived there were a million more professional things she did like acrobatics in Cirque du Soleil??? In my personal life experience, I have tried many things that I’m good at and many things I’m not so good at (guitar is not my forte). Why weren’t there any examples where she tried and failed at something or was even just mediocre? Mediocrity is okay, in fact I feel it sends a wrong message to people that struggle with the thought of suicide in a sense of ‘Look how much cool stuff you could have done and been and you wouldn’t have failed as badly as you have in this life.’ Wtf is that??That’s honestly my hugest complaint with this story which is why I rated it a 3. I wanted to love this book and at times I felt is was engaging and fun and a bit of a heartstrings tugger. I just didn’t feel connected to this book like I really wanted to be.

When Nora Seed enters the Midnight Library, she is able to pull books off the shelves and experience all the different lives that she could have lived if she’d made a few different choices. As someone who regularly questions every little thing that I do, this one really hit me hard.Whilst I did really enjoy this one and the writing style, it conveyed its (very important) message with all the subtlety of a hammer through a glass wall.

It’s a bit like googling and old boyfriend and feeling relieved (or not) that your 17-year-old self had the good sense to break up with him. Nora is in her thirties and feels bogged down with regrets. Her life is stale, she has no partner or children, her cat has just died and her brother is not answering her calls. So she decides to take her life. But instead of dying, she is magically transported into a magic library where she can explore all her regrets and see how her life would have been if she had been more courageous and made “better” decisions. As soon as she opens a different book of her own life, she is magically transported into her alternative life as it would be right now had she made a different decision in her past – to stick with her band, to study glaciology, to continue with her swimming career. The strange thing, I thought, was that Nora was dumped into these other lives without context or knowledge of her past in that particular life, or the people surrounding her. I found this extremely anxiety provoking! But I won’t give anything away here, because I don’t want to spoil your fun exploring this premise for yourself.I wanted to love this book as much as I liked its premise, but strangely didn’t find it as compelling as many other readers. Don’t get me wrong, it was an original and somewhat intriguing read, but didn’t grab me emotionally as much as I thought it would. I also found the ending predictable, though I hoped until the last page that the author would prove me wrong – he didn’t. Maybe my expectations were just too high. And because I can’t discuss the finer points without giving away spoilers I will just leave it at that. Thousands of readers have loved this thought-provoking and magical tale, so it’s best you go and judge for yourself. It certainly made me reflect on those crossroads in my life that may have led me into a totally different direction.

However, once I completed this novel I was left bittersweet, and since all of this review relies on the end, the rest of this review will contain mild spoilers, although it\\'s not a book based on mystery so is it even a spoiler? Your choice.A wise character who shall remain unnamed once said,  \\'the hardest thing in this world is to live in it.\\'  At first, it appears that our main character who committed suicide learnt that lesson once (spoiler alert) she makes the choice to to live again. However, once I sat down and truly reflected on this book, I realized one thing: Nora understands half of this sentence. She understands that life is a choice and one with heavy consequences, on par with existential belief. But she doesn\\'t seem to understand that life is an everyday struggle, every day choice, as existential philosophers also believed in.I think this \\'I\\'m going to live now, no more laziness, no more fear of failure, no more regrets\\' is very toxic. This fake productivity mentality influenced by a simplistic interpretation of existential philosophy is at the root of a lot of mental issues people face which is sold by capitalism in order to sell more fake-productivity shit we don\\'t need or really want. And I\\'m quite disappointed that this book takes this fake-deep approach to existentialism, which can let a reader feel guilty for not immediately getting up and doing the dishes they didn\\'t want to do earlier.Life is an everyday choice, precisely because it\\'s hard. Choices wouldn\\'t be choices if they were easy to make.This book didn\\'t add that nuance to its interpretation of existentialism: because one can be authentic by making choices and owning up to the consequences that come with them. However, one can sometimes make the choice to sit still or make bad choices, and maybe to be your most authentic self, one needs to refuse to make choices (ironically it\\'s a choice in itself, I know,) and accept the responsibility of the bad ones and hope for the best. Basically don\\'t make people feel like sh*t for feeling like sh*t and staying in bed. The book seems so lost in trying to mimic existentialism that it forgot the nuance of the philosophy, the part that would actually be helpful to readers as it would show that Nora, even in the end, when she has chosen life, remains human and will still trip and fall once in a while. And sometimes in those trips and falls she\\'ll make a bad choice once again and fighting for life will be difficult again, and that\\'s reassuring.What\\'s important about existentialism isn\\'t making \"good\" choices, it\\'s learning from your mistakes and never quitting the fight.Besides, there are no good or bad choices, there are only choices you make, those you don\\'t, and their consequences.At its core, existentialism is about fighting, not about making \"good choices,\" and that\\'s not what the end of the book reflects at all. It shows Nora, suddenly happy go lucky after her suicide attempt and excited to tackle life, and I wish we would have seen some of her trials and tribulations in the future, and saw how she learnt from her mistakes, and how she\\'s willing to fight now.Now, that would have been a book that would make people feel better and reflect on their lives a bit.To conclude, I\\'m coming for Sartre\\'s job.  ...more The Midnight Library is bestselling author Matt Haig’s latest novel and is an enchanting, beguiling and delightful story from the first page through to the last; there is an effortlessness about his prose that almost immediately sweeps you up and immerses you in the story.

Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe, there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better? In The Midnight Library, thirty-four-year-old Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.This is a captivating, charming and moving read with the perfect combination of aspects to make this novel as special as it is: a taut and absorbing plot, a rollercoaster ride of emotional peaks and troughs, a superbly developed cast of characters, a relatable and very likeable protagonist in Nora, and beautiful writing. As with most Haig novels, it is thought-provoking, imaginative and has you ruminating about love and life, trials and tribulations, fear and hope. For a huge bookworm such as myself, books about books are an extra special treat when they are well written and I knew I could place my faith in Haig to pen another brilliantly absorbing tale. There are twists, turns and surprises aplenty as it progresses and not only is it humorous in places but it manages to be raw and empathetic towards the human condition too.

I enjoyed all the different stories (lives) the main character had to endure trying to figured out what she wanted out of her own life. 4.25 starsThe Midnight Library is fast and easy to read, centering around the question - If you could choose between all possible versions of your life, which one would you choose? Definitely a unique concept and also dealing with more serious issues such as depression, this was nonetheless surprisingly easy and fast to get through, without actually losing its profundity.

I love this author’s writing style and use of language in his writing/books.I simultaneously read a Kindle e-book and a Overdrive audiobook (both from the library) and I loved Carey Mulligan’s narration for the audiobook. For me her voice tone and inflections were perfection. She mispronounced some words though. At first I just thought it was English vs. American pronunciation but some words, including a place name of a place near me, were obviously being said incorrectly. I loved the parallel/multiple universes/alternative lives possibilities. Great fun!The power of love! The power of seeing the importance of minor choices! Being yourself!I guess the story is meant to be uplifting and inspirational, even to those feeling despair, but it will depend on readers and their perspectives how they will react to this book. No matter how it’s a great story with great characters. 4-1/2 starsI could have chosen even more quotes to “like” but here is a sampling of those I appreciated:“Never underestimate the big importance of small things.” “Well, that you can choose choices but not outcomes.”“Doing one thing differently is often the same as doing everything differently. Actions can’t be reversed within a lifetime, however much we try”“The only way to learn is to live” “Regrets don’t leave. They weren’t mosquito bites. They itch forever.”“Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations.”““Equidistant. Such a neutral, mathematical kind of word, and one that became a stuck thought, repeating itself like a manic meditation as she used the last of her strength to stay almost exactly where she was. Equidistant. Equidistant. Equidistant. Not aligned to one bank or the other. That was how she had felt most of her life. Caught in the middle. Struggling, flailing, just trying to survive while not knowing which way to go. Which path to commit to without regret.”“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?” “A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.”“Maybe that’s what all lives were, though. Maybe even the most seemingly perfectly intense or worthwhile lives ultimately felt the same. Acres of disappointment and monotony and hurts and rivalries but with flashes of wonder and beauty. Maybe that was the only meaning that mattered.”“Maybe even suicide would have been too active. Maybe in some lives you just float around and expect nothing else and don’t even try to change. Maybe that was most lives. ‘Yes,’ said Nora, aloud now. ‘Maybe I got stuck. Maybe in every life I am stuck. I mean, maybe that’s just who I am. A starfish in every life is still a starfish. There isn’t a life where a starfish is a professor of aerospace engineering. And maybe there isn’t a life where I’m not stuck.”“The life of a human, according to the Scottish philosopher David Hume, was of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster. But if it was important enough for David Hume to write that thought down, then maybe it was important enough to aim to do something good. To help preserve life, in all its forms.”“Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.”“it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunize you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.’”““Nora wanted to live in a world where no cruelty existed, but the only worlds she had available to her were worlds with humans in them.”“We only know what we perceive. Everything we experience is ultimately just our perception of it. “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”“She realized that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality. As Thoreau wrote, ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”“It was as though she had reached some state of acceptance about life–that if there was a bad experience, there wouldn’t only be bad experiences. She realized that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery. That, she supposed, was the basis of depression as well as the difference between fear and despair. Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when the door closed and locked behind you.” ...more 4.5 stars, loved it! The only thing I really wish for is some more!

Embrace that you-ness. Endorse it. Love it. Work hard at it. And don\\'t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it.

I had no clue what this book was about before putting my name on the library waiting list. I simply knew I really enjoyed The Radleys so I’m more than happy to continue reading Matt Haig’s stuff. The story here is about Nora, a 35 year old woman who has decided to end her life. (Obviously – trigger warning.) She then finds herself in the “Midnight Library” – a limbo of sorts where every potential life you could have lived depending on the choices you made is available on the shelves. You simply have to choose the volume you would like to read. Find one you like? You can remain there forever. Determine that you were correct and life is truly hopeless for you, the library will crumble out of existence. To me this was a modernization of one of my favorites . . . .

And those choices lead to different outcomes. If you had done just one thing differently, you would have a different life story. And they all exist in the Midnight Library. They are all as real as this life.”Matt Haig presents his readers with a touching and ultimately life-affirming tale of second chances. The Midnight Library follows Nora, a lonely thirty-five-year-old woman from Bedford, who has just hit rock bottom. She\\'s single, her only maybe-friend lives in Australia, her brother seems to hate her or at least he makes a point of avoiding her, and she has just been fired from String Theory, the music shop she worked for the past twelve years. Nora is tired of being sad and miserable, of being eaten up regrets. She\\'s exhausted of living. What awaits Nora is the Midnight Library, a place that sits “between life and death” and where “the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices”. Each book presents Nora with another version of her life. What if she had kept training as a swimmer? What if she had married her ex? What if she\\'d stayed in her brother\\'s band? What if she\\'d kept on studying?The possibilities are infinite and Nora finds herself wanting to experiences them all. As she jumps from book to book Nora soon realises that there isn\\'t such a thing as the perfect life. Even in the life in which she has pursued swimming her relationship with her father isn\\'t great. By living all these different lives, Nora\\'s no longer feels guilty for not doing what others expected or pressured her to do. Happiness is a tricky thing, and it cannot be achieved by simply acquiescing to others desires.Haig\\'s imbues Nora\\'s story with plenty of humour. Although the story touches on mental health (depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, panic attacks, addiction) the narrative maintains an underlining note of hope. Haig showcases great empathy, never condemning anyone as being responsible for another person\\'s unhappiness.Although the novel isn\\'t too sentimental it did feel a bit too uplifting (I know, I am a grinch). Perhaps I wanted to story to delve in darker territories but Nora\\'s story is rather innocuous. Still, this was a heart-warming book, and the \\'what if\\' scenarios could be very entertaining as I was never bored. Haig as a penchant for dialogues and discussing mental health related issues with both clarity and sensitivity.

I wish I had read this earlier, but I am glad I found it now.The Midnight Library is about a character named Nora seed. Nora is struggling with her identity and she is on her last straw and knee deep in sadness. When her cat dies, she decides she is done and attempts suicide. Except, she does not die and instead, there is an entire library of lives waiting for her on the other side. This is a tale of regret and hope and second chances and it was very, very powerful. Everytime I think about this book, I feel a certain amount of admiration and love because I can’t imagine how hard this was to write for the author. This deals with some very heavy topics, I could barely even grasp the edges of it. Personally, I have not had much loss in my life, nor have I felt the way Nora did about herself but, I could still relate to this, to a certain extent. I think I might read this again when I’m older, when I have seen the true ugliness and roughness of life and I bear the scars of it. Until then, I will still read this many times because it makes me feel a lot. It makes me reflect on my regrets and desires and impulsiveness. It makes me sympathise and hope and admire. It makes me want to thank my family and friends for simply being there for me.In the end, this may not be an easy read for many but I definitely suggest you read it if you feel lost or full of regret. Even if you do not, I still recommend you read this because it\\'s an eye-opening, heartbreaking and extremely powerful book.

Having to face that fact and accept that you can\\'t turn back time, might bring you peace but it\\'s also hard. So in a way, this book had a soothing moment for me.Nevertheless, the ending was obvious from the start - I had actually expected the author to pull a twist of some kind so I was surprised when that never came. *lol*The writing style was also very nice with short-ish chapters that made even the darkest themes more bearable (important due to the subject matter). Nothing groundbreaking but definitely very important and enjoyable. ...more Brilliant If you love stories about parallel universes, philosophy and quantum physics this may be the story for you!It has been years since a book has left me so spell bound and transfixed.

A library full of books, the lives she could have lived had she made different choices. With the assistance of the librarian Nora goes on to live and experience some of the lives she could have lived.“The only way to learn is to live.”In her root life Nora studied philosophy at university and I loved that there were many mentions and quotes from famous philosophers.

What if I had moved there instead of here? What if I had stayed in touch with that friend? And so on. I know Matt Haig has written a memoir Reasons to Stay Alive in which he documents his struggles with depression and his search for meaning and I’m guessing his personal experiences have helped shape the themes and narrative of this book.Nora Seed, our main character, is in her mid-30s, has just lost her job and her cat and is feeling pretty down and has plenty of regrets. I won’t put in a spoiler explaining why, but Nora finds herself in the Midnight Library where she comes across the Book of Regrets of her life in which every regret she has had ever had since the day she was born is recorded. Nora realises quickly that they range from the minor “I regret not doing any exercise today” to the substantial “I regret not telling my father I loved him before he died”. In the Midnight Library, with the assistance of her favourite school librarian Mrs Elm, she has access to parallel universes and can immerse herself and actually live in a particular life and see if she likes it or not. She finds herself in a life where, rather than quit swimming at 14, she does continue with it and was good enough to get to the Olympics; she transfers to another life where, rather than call off her wedding at the last moment, she does marry Dan and they are running a country pub as was previously discussed and planned; in another experience, rather than use commitments as an excuse to stay home, she does go to Australia with her friend Lizzy. As well as all of these lives related to her ‘root life’, she gets to taste a wild array of other lives at her whim and fancy.I think this book is a lot of fun. I can understand how some readers may feel it treats the serious subject matter in an overly light-hearted way but it worked for me and I am adding it to my 2020 favourites.Nora really is in a state of despair, she has always struggled to accept herself and she can’t find any reason to keep living - but I didn’t at any stage feel weighed down by Nora’s state of mind and her feeling of helplessness. Instead I found it uplifting and inspiring. For that reason alone I have to give it 5 stars. Matt Haig has done a great job of weaving in a healthy dose of philosophy (e.g. Thoreau’s “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see”), along with servings of humour, time travel, quantum physics and parallel universes to look at what it is to be human and to find meaning in your life.……....It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not the lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It’s the regret that makes us shrivel and whither and feel like our own and other people’s worst enemy……We just have to close our eyes and savour the taste of the drink in front of us and listen to the song as it plays. We are completely and utterly alive as we are in any other life and have access to the same emotional spectrum.... Yesterday it was impossible for me to accept my life as it is now. And yet today that same messy life seems full of hope. Potential. ...more This book talks about so many different topics, but most of it all it is about regret and the paths we take in life.

Matt Haig’s writing is raw and beautiful, whilst also conveying so many important messages in a brilliantly told story. Haig uses Nora to tell his story, Nora is dreadfully unhappy and suffering from depression, but from this darkness, Nora is given a choice. She is given the chance to look at all the paths she could have taken in life and see if she wants to settle in one of them. She can look at her very own book of regrets and can explore each avenue to see what would have happened if she’d have explored different angles in her life.I doubt there is a person alive that lives with zero regrets, and if there is, I take my hat off to them. But the sheer relatability of this book means I think I’d recommend it to near enough anyone. Nora sees so many different lives she could have had, she is rich, poor, alone, married, has a child, has a cat, is famous, is working her dream job. This book lets the reader live out their own dreams through Nora and I love that about it. Nora is so real and just… well… human. She could be you or your friend or your neighbour. Haig has done a truly fantastic job at bringing his readers to life in the pages of these books, which makes this book read as something very special indeed.Aside from the leading concept of this book, it also looks at our relationships with others, how we treat those we love, how we treat ourselves, our planet. At one point Nora works in climate change and we get an insight into the failings we as humans are offering to our planet. Matt Haig honestly does try to put a lot of issues into this book of humanity and he succeeds. This book is almost an anthem of literature for change, regret and living our lives how we want to live them. I really liked that this book certainly leaves you wanting to live your life to the full, but also that doesn’t have to be scuba diving and cliff diving, it can be enjoying the things you love and finding joy in them.This book was such a simple concept that just dug so deep into its themes. I always think Matt Haig does a brilliant job of normalising talking about mental health and this book is no exception. He clearly writes from experience and with care. Reading this book may make you feel a little less alone, I would highly advise it. ...more 4.25 stars!! This book is so, so good. So magical.

It was so fun and interesting reading about all the potential lives that Nora experienced in the library. The fact that this book had some fantasy aspects in it, (when usually fantasy books, no matter how big or small the fantasy element is, are not my thing) but this one had just the right amount of magic as well as real life. I love Matt Haig\\'s writing. I was really drawn to his words when I first read \\'Notes on a Nervous Planet\\' which was a book that really helped me when I was in a really hard place mentally. \\'The Midnight Library\\' was so real about mental health, but Matt Haig also speaks to positively and it\\'s almost like he wrote the book just for you, to help you, and to show you that everything will be okay. ...more I\\'m not going to recap this book, it\\'s been done enough in other reviews but it\\'s a wonderful read.

If I compare it to The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue - and I have to compare it to Addie LaRue - yes, the basic concept, the idea behind this book totally worked for me. It hooked me. But while I was head over heels in love with The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, my feelings for this one are lukewarm at best. Why? Because I am in love with the concept, nothing more. That\\'s it. It\\'s like a relationship based only on physical attraction. Or, to say it with the book itself: \"We had great times. But there is more to life than fantastic sex.\"  Yes, the pitch is great: Nora, the protagonist, is in a really dark place emotionally, overwhelmed with regrets about the decisions she\\'s made in her life. And she gets a chance to live a life where she hasn\\'t made the wrong decisions, where she doesn\\'t end up in that dark place - and who can\\'t relate to that? Having regrets is a very human thing. Regrets are one thing that sets humanity apart, because nothing else on this planet has regrets. Well, I think my cat may regret that it wasn\\'t born as a tiger, but I can\\'t be sure of that, so it doesn\\'t count.  So that\\'s the pitch. The pitch works, because every single one of us can understand Nora. We all regret something, be it that we didn\\'t ask a certain person on a date, that we didn\\'t choose another job, that we didn\\'t bet a lot of money on the Patriots when they were down 3-28 in the Super Bowl. Life is full of regrets, so we can relate to Nora, just like we can relate to Addie: we all regret things, and we all want to be remembered. Pitch: check. Everything else: sorry, didn\\'t care. Yes, I didn\\'t care. It\\'s a cute book, I enjoyed it, but - cold-blooded, stone-hearted monster that I am: I didn\\'t care. Because I knew where this was going to end, and because the road there wasn\\'t intriguing enough to make me enjoy it. Yes, there were some heartbreaking moments had to face, but in a way I kept thinking: this isn\\'t real. No matter how often Schrödinger\\'s Cat was mentioned, I didn\\'t feel this was real. This wasn\\'t like Harry and Dumbledore at King\\'s Cross, this couldn\\'t make me feel for the characters. It does for a lot of people, but not for me.  The prose isn\\'t my thing. It\\'s too reduced to reach me, it\\'s... bland? Not sure I can say that. But it never enchants me, and there are only two quotes I marked while reading this book: \"A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts let you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a dew dodgy side-streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.\"\"And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn\\'t over if there is a single pawn still left on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn - maybe we all are - then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary, but it isn\\'t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.\"  The latter one sounds like a real good pep speech, I\\'ll try to use it for my football team at some point. Anyway, the bottom line is: it obviously works for a lot of people but it didn\\'t work for me. It failed to deliver the X-factor, it never managed to enchant me - three stars.----Dialogue 4Setting 4Characters 3Writing Style 3Plot 3 ...more Well, this book has a great premise and will appeal to a wide range of audience.

I felt similar about Frederik Backman\\'s Beartown as well - highly quotable book ; yet doesn\\'t give feel \\'mature enough\\' (though Beartown is a much better book). And, the way the philosophy is incorporated into the story feels a bit lame at a few places.For instance, see this conversation :Mrs Elm quickly rummaged for the paper tissue.... she brought it quickly to her face and sneezed into it.‘Bless you,’ said Nora, watching as the tissue disappeared from the librarian’s hands...‘Don’t worry. Tissues are like lives. There are always more.’ Mrs Elm returned to her train of thought. ‘Doing one thing differently is often the same as doing everything differently.\\'Now you have to philosophize sneezing into paper tissue as well!

After losing her cat, her job, and is full of regret, she takes her own life. However, she suddenly finds herself in the Midnight Library – a point between life and death – and learns that she has an opportunity to live as if she had done things differently. She had felt like she had let everyone down, including herself. But things are about to change.“Because, Nora, sometimes the only way to learn is to live.”The concept of ‘The Midnight Library’ is wonderful, Nora Seed has hit an all-time low. After losing her cat, her job, and is full of regret, she takes her own life. However, she suddenly finds herself in the Midnight Library – a point between life and death – and learns that she has an opportunity to live as if she had done things differently. She had felt like she had let everyone down, including herself. But things are about to change.“Because, Nora, sometimes the only way to learn is to live.”The concept of ‘The Midnight Library’ is wonderful, and Haig executes it brilliantly. How different could life be if we made another choice? How could one decision change the lives of the people around us? And, is there any such thing as a perfect life? In one life Nora is an internationally famous rock star. In another, she works as a scientist in sub-zero temperatures in the Norwegian archipelago. She is an Olympic athlete, a vegan powerlifter, rich, poor: the possibilities are infinite. Throughout it all, Haig seamlessly interjects magic into the most prosaic of details. Furthermore, in his bestselling memoir ‘Reasons to Stay Alive‘, Haig chronicled the personal anxiety and depression he experienced which lead him to consider taking his own life. In ‘The Midnight Library’, he is just as unflinching in his depiction of depression. He seamlessly articulates how debilitating it can be, how it can feel like you’re stuck in a black hole. And yet, his writing never feels dismal. Rather, he counterbalances sombre moments with a hopeful tone and a touch of humour. While sometimes Nora’s monologues were repetitive, the meaning was clear: even when you feel like you’re trapped, there is always a way out of the darkness.There’s so much more to unpack in this book. From ideas around climate change and the connection between ourselves and the world to familial relationships, fame, and the nature of happiness. Matt Haig tackles so many themes with such grace: a reminder to live life to the fullest and appreciate every moment, even the hard ones. As Nora tries on the many shoes of her infinite lives, we see how making space for regrets is one step towards softening their hold over us. We can have regrets without being their prisoner.Overall, ‘The Midnight Library’ is a truly inspiring story that, yes, is full of hurt and despair, but also love and transformation. Haig eloquently articulates the consuming nature of depression for those who find that words escape them. As with ‘Reasons to Stay Alive’, I’m so grateful for this book and vouch that everyone should read it. The only way to learn is to live.Thank you Matt Haig, Canongate Books, and NetGalley for my eARC in exchange for an honest review!4.5/5 stars rounded up to 5 ...more “Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever.

She has been fired from her job, her cat died and her relationships with other people are unstable. Nothing appears to be going well so Nora decides to end it. Except that she winds up in the Midnight Library instead. In it, there are thousands of books with the thousands of possible lives Nora could have lived if she had made different choices. Nora is told that she can choose one book at a time to live in. If she finds a life she likes better, she can stay there permanently. So as Nora starts exploring all the \\'what-ifs\\', she begins to appreciate life anew.\"The only way to learn is to live.\"This is a book I had my eye for a while so when I saw it on the list for best fiction, I decided to not wait any longer to read it. For a relatively short book, it packs a punch. Nora Seed is not okay. She has been fired, her cat died and none of the relationships in her life are working out. She decides to stop trying. But then something unusual happens. She winds up in the Midnight Library. Suddenly, all the lives she could have had are laid before her. All she has to do is pick a book, enter a different life and see if its better than her current one. As she goes through her regrets and undoes some of her past decisions, it becomes clearer that maybe there is no such thing as a perfect life. The short chapters made this narrative flow quite nicely. The prose is simple but powerful. The concept is impactful. Who has not wished for a different outcome in life at some point? There is a mention of quantum physics in the story but it is not overwhelming and is simply explained. Above all, this book is thoughful and well rendered. The tone is solemn. Its not a book that can be called fun or entertaining but its certainly memorable. This is the first time I read a book by Matt Haig and I have just learned that he deals with mental health issues. His observations and thoughts do reflect that, they are honest and hopeful. I am glad to hae read this book and will look into more books by Haig in the future. ...more \"It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see\".Regrets, Choices, Chances, Decisions, Closures, and Acceptances… Those are the 6 BIG words that came into mind after reading \"The Midnight Library.\" Nora Seed, at 35, is hopeless, helpless, and lost.

Nora is faced with decisions to change her life for the better, followed another career, undoing a mess-up relationship, and perhaps go after her passion. At the heart of the book, the beautiful concept derived from philosophical multiple universe theory develops from every choice and decision, though it was not discussed in depth. The focus is mainly on Nora\\'s disposition to go on living or to end it all. Nora\\'s depressive and indecisive character may seem languid but good enough to be contemplative. An introspective book that ended on a crucial note leaving meditative thoughts about life in perspective. The narrative is pleasant, engaging, and comfortable, liken to a magical story where it can foster one\\'s imagination for a good night\\'s dream. Eventually, as I followed Nora\\'s journey in her life, I realized no perfect life.

I felt understood. I felt like I was not alone. I felt like everything could and would be okay, because you are more than the sum of your depressive episodes. You are an amazing human being with an infinite number of possibilities.Like Nora, I felt underfulfilled most of my life and destined to live a bland, boring, and ordinary life. Why should I even aspire for more and to become more? That\\'s life. Life sucks. What can you do about it? You can work hard and achieve a lot of things, but at the end of the day your life expectancy would still be around 70-80 years at best. I always felt like I could hope for more, and that is all that was. Hope. But then when my life was accidentally on the line, the most primitive instict kicked it. To live. So should one listen to the primitive part of the brain, telling him/her/them to stay alive? Or better listen to that more evolutionarily developed portion of his/her/their brain, the neocortex, forming the conscious mind and giving the possibility to form coherent train of thoughts, forcing you to analyze every tiny bit of your life and telling you there\\'s basically nothing special about it after all? Because the greatest sin of humankind is mistakingly thinking we are somehow more important than we actually are, or just as we wrongly believe ourselves to be. We are maybe important to someone or several someones, but to the univerese we are no more significant than a grain of salt.\"That was how she had felt most of her life.Caught in the middle. Struggling, flailing, just trying to survive while not knowing which way to go. Which path to commit to without regret.\"I related so much to Nora (give and take a few things), and maybe that\\'s what made this book such an \"enlightening\" experience for me? I\\'m certain all of us, even the most optimistic ones, found himself or herself or themselves in a depressive state at least once or twice in their life. This book does not perpetuate your depression, nor does it feed it. On the contrary, it gives you a pure glance as an outsider into the mind of a struggling depressed person trying to find the will to live. And I know there are literally thousands of books about depression (which I usually can\\'t stand readimg), and idk why but this book in particular was and is very special to me. Maybe it\\'s the extra touch of fantasy, which I can never, for the life of me, turn down? \"She didn\\'t want to die. And she didn\\'t want to live any other life than the one that was hers.

Way too much of the book is in this irritating vein. I’ve noticed some British writers use the words “at all” (pronounced “eh toll”) too much. Don’t “It was nothing” and “It was nothing at all” mean exactly the same goddamn thing? Once you notice this, it becomes like trying to ignore a Tourette’s Syndrome verbal tick. She wondered for a moment if she shouldn’t get the door at allgone in wonderful directions, but now went nowhere at allshe could no longer see the walls at allIt was possible that the shelves weren’t moving at allit will hardly be there at all.they couldn’t really be seen as individual books at all.she was no longer a person reading it, and a consequent moment where there was no book – or library – at all.Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all.The house key had no information on it at all,floating in a tank that resembles nothing at all.And this time she was aware of feeling absolutely nothing at all.No problem at allShe said it casually, almost as if it was nothing at all.And then decided he didn’t want to go to uni at all.And the moment she had said it was nice to be there, was also the moment she wasn’t there at allAre there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change?Hardly a laugh at all.Nothing. Nothing at all.In most lives I don’t know you at allShe felt like she might not have been there at all. P142Or soon there won’t be a choice at all.Not a message at all but a photo of a whale.the chandeliers, the flowers, all became nothing at all.So why live at all?but without really knowing him or thinking about him at all.Not long at all.in most she wasn’t a hypochondriac at allA memory so vague and intangible it will hardly be there at allstanding there without any fear at allcouldn’t see anything at all nowOnce I started this search, I couldn’t stop. So yeah, anyone care to explain this to me? Take out “at all” from any of these phrases and the meaning is exactly the same, if anything, this verbal tick, this redundancy, dilutes the negative.Sorry, but Groundhog Day tells a story ten times more interesting than anything you will find between the covers of this young adult novel. The philosophy in this was childish, like the author had just read a Wikipedia article on the subject before stuffing it into this book. I would never consider Henry David Thoreau to be a philosopher.I read How to Stop Time by this writer. I thought the premise was amazing, but the execution was absolutely dreadful and annoying. I didn’t really care for the premise of this book. I don’t think people look back and put blame on the regrets of their life. He just doesn’t tell any good stories. Nothing happens in this that I care to remember a day later. ...more Nora Seed hasn\\'t had the best week, in fact let\\'s just say that she hasn\\'t had the best life.

Her brother who is the only family she has doesn\\'t want anything to do with her. But after she\\'s let go from her job and her cat dying on the same day, she can\\'t think of living anymore and decides to commit suicide. She wakes up in a library and finds her school librarian, Mrs Elm there and Mrs Elm informs Nora that she is in an in-between place and here she has an infinite number of lives that she could choose from. All she has to do is go through The book of regrets and choose a different life and she\\'ll end up there. If she is disappointed there, she\\'ll come back to the midnight library and she can choose another life.  She stepped outside, wondering whether a life could really be judged from just a few minutes after midnight on a Tuesday. Or maybe that was all you needed. Nora tries life after life but she always ends up not liking it or being a stranger in her own life no matter how popular or how successful or how rich she is and always ends up back at the library. Mrs Elm smiled, wryly. \\'It just shows you, doesn\\'t it?\\'\\'Shows me what?\\'\\'Well, that you can choose choices but not outcomes. But I stand by what I said. It was a good choice. It just wasn\\'t a desired outcome.\\' Then Mrs Elm tells Nora that maybe she should try lives where the regrets weren\\'t obvious. Even after trying those lives and even liking one where she thought that it could be her new life, she still ends up at the midnight library and at last she understands that she won\\'t feel at home in any of her other lives because even though technically all of those are her lives, practically she didn\\'t live them.  Are there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change? She does get fresh perspective through her journey and she also realizes that she wants to live. Never underestimate the big importance of small things. She wakes up in her root life and decides to turn everything around as her perspective has changed. That the prison wasn\\'t the place, but the perspective. She decides to teach piano lessons and also catch up with Mrs Elm even though she doesn\\'t remember Nora and it is not the same Mrs Elm from the midnight library. She also makes up with her brother. May be there was no perfect life for her, but somewhere, surely, there was a life worth living. This was such a great read. I loved the writing and I was engrossed from the very beginning. I didn\\'t like Nora in the beginning but she grew on me and I was rooting for her throughout. I felt her journey like it was my own journey. How many times have I thought of making different decisions but I also know that if I were given the chance all over again, I would still make those exact same decisions because they felt right in my heart at the time. (view spoiler)[I suspected how it would end but more that that I wanted Nora to choose her root life right after the sadness she felt in her first alternate life and I am so very happy to know that\\'s exactly how it ends.

Well folks, I had every reason to love this book. I\\'m a fairly big fan of multiverse stories and I enjoy a tale in which a character comes to some personal revelation through fantastical means. What\\'s more, my wife picked it up for my birthday and she tends to hit the target almost infallibly. Even though the writing is snappy, readable, and moves rather quickly, I just couldn\\'t get down with the obvious aims of the story. In the book\\'s opening pages our lead, Nora Seed, decides to take her own life and finds herself in a library that houses every possible variation of her life. From there we get bits and bobs of philosophy, quantum physics, and cognitive behavioural therapy as plot. Herein lies the rub: the book felt more like self-help than adventurous or revelatory. The plot-as-therapy beats came off a bit too heavy-handed and I found I could see the ending a mile away. I\\'m sure for a lot of people in 2021 this book lands at a resonant moment. Lots of people are in a tough space, mentally, and Nora\\'s misanthropic zipping through the multiverse is relatable, but the lessons she learns are also applicable to everyday life. I don\\'t begrudge this experience of the novel, I just found it personally grating. There are some good passages in here and one of the last lives Nora lives in the novel hits an emotional peak that failed to land with the other quantum forays. It\\'s not that this is a terrible work, it\\'s just one that didn\\'t work for me. It\\'s a shame I didn\\'t enjoy this more, but providing Haig\\'s other work is less narrative CBT manual, I think I\\'d be into it.

She chooses different partners, specialties, and locations. These vignettes introduce humor into the narrative, as Nora finds herself talking to people who know her, but she does not know them, nor does she know the context up to the point where she joined this particular version of her life. For me, the only drawback is that it sometimes takes Nora almost no time to determine a particular version of her life is not to her liking (this happens, as you may expect, numerous times). I enjoy Matt Haig’s writing style and appreciate his desire to help those suffering from depression. It is a creative take on the concept of a multiverse.  ...more New Favorite.

It\\'s a bittersweet coincidence then that The Midnight Library was published on the eighth anniversary of my brother\\'s suicide and that the lead character, Nora Seed should be suicidal herself.I can\\'t pretend that the early chapters were easy to read - over the course of a few days Nora reaches the point where she decides that she wants to die - but I was reading it during what is always an emotional week for me. As the story progresses, Nora is given the opportunity to explore what her life could have been like had she made other choices or decisions as Matt Haig returns to the life-affirming themes I have come to associate with his books. Written with deep understanding and warm-hearted honesty; The Midnight Library is a thought-provoking, perceptive paean to hope and the power of books.Nora learns that she can undo her regrets and in her Midnight Library, guided by her old school librarian, Mrs Elms, the books on the shelves are filled with her alternative lives. As she hovers between life and death in her original or \\'root\\' life, she is able to experience what it would have been like to have followed her dreams or even just agreed to a coffee. If she ever finds a life she likes, she\\'ll be able to stay in it and will eventually forget the Midnight Library. She might run a country pub with her husband (the man she jilted just before her wedding in her root life), be a glaciologist working alongside other scientists in the Arctic or perform to packed out stadiums as a world-famous rock star. However, it turns out that no matter how exciting or interesting her life may be, she keeps returning to the library. Although there are an infinite number of lives contained in the books, if Nora dies the library and everything in it will be destroyed. My favourite film of all time is It\\'s a Wonderful Life and there are elements of The Midnight Library that are reminiscent of that story. Just as George Bailey was forced to put his dreams on hold time and again, so Nora is filled with regrets for what she has lost or missed out on. Both George and Nora feel trapped and stifled in their home towns but George has Clarence to show him what he means to the people of Bedford Falls and it can\\'t be a coincidence that Mrs Elms is there to guide Nora towards finding out that her actions affected more than just her own life in Bedford. This is an uplifting novel but like It\\'s a Wonderful Life, it has a darker side and doesn\\'t forget that life can be difficult and painful. There is no Mr Potter here but Nora\\'s own personal villain is her depression and that she has allowed her regrets to define who she believes she is; as always Matt Haig writes about mental health issues with compassionate insight and sensitivity. The Midnight Library may be a fantastical premise but it is never false and through an accessible and engaging mix of quantum physics. philosophy and love, Matt Haig tells a beautiful, poignant and empathetic story of redemption and hope. The Midnight Library is the perfect reminder that even when times are tough, it can still be a wonderful life.  ...more \"She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality.

Through the story of a depressed Millennial woman named Nora, it is a dramatized self-inquiry exercise—assessing regrets, what personal success is, etc.—that may be particularly appreciated by a depressed, suicidal person or somebody who believes they would be happy “if only my life were different and I had XYZ.” I’m none of those things, but I enjoyed it, although I did get bored 60 percent through it—around the place where Nora, living a life as a famous rock star, talks about her famous song “Howl,” with apparently no awareness of the era-defining poem of the same name by Allen Ginsberg.*I don’t write sweet, but this book’s opening and premise were eerily familiar because I practically wrote it decades ago in a short piece before the moniker “flash fiction” existed. (An updated version, revised after the Recession, is included in my anthology  Girl Stories & Game Plays .) For people who have read Haig’s book, I’m including it here so you can see the similarity but maybe laugh:Turning the PageWith a rattling gasp, she closed the book, arose from her dilapidated desk chair and glided soundlessly out of her cubicle, down the corridor, and through the heavy metal door. Funny, she thought. Usually it was locked, but it had given way with a touch. She\\'d never opened this door, let alone passed through its threshold. On the other side, she\\'d expected all manner of monsters: fire-breathing dragons, devils with red laser eyes, drunk writers with sour whiskey breath. There were no monsters. Nor was there a great white light where her rotten relatives—now dead and therefore enlightened—reached out to grasp her to their bosoms and chests, apologizing for all their corporeal sins against her and welcoming her to join them and also become good, sweet, and enlightened. Nor were there gates, pearly or otherwise—which made her smile, as she\\'d always known those were fairy stories and she\\'d never bought into them. Nor were there parallel universes where she could peek at her body doubles doing all the things she had thought about but failed to even attempt in her pathetic little life spent reading stacks and stacks of terrible slush-pile books as the only sixty-five-year-old editorial assistant in the history of book publishing.She\\'d always known she would die there. She\\'d known it was a matter of time until she read a book so horrendous that it killed her, and when she was finished, she would merely drop it on the floor, knowing that she had reached the end.\"Hello!\" she called into the fog. \"I\\'m dead. Is anybody here?\"In response, a new door materialized just in front of her and, as it creaked open, she was hit by a puff of familiar smell: books, new books that had become bestsellers after she\\'d rescued them from the slush pile, pushed them on her bosses, and been so annoying that they\\'d finally read them—only to take full credit for discovering them.\"I\\'m very angry,\" she said to the smell. \"There is nobody here to greet me, and I\\'m so sick of books. Do you think you could take your smell somewhere else? No offense,\" she added because she\\'d always been a very polite editorial assistant, which is perhaps why she\\'d managed to hang on even through the Great Recession and blood bath of early 2009 when most of her department had been laid off, but old habits don\\'t disappear just because you croak.In response, the smell turned left. She stepped through the new door and turned right, although there really was no such thing in this new world. For twelve hours she walked, although there really was no time and her cheap Timex (a gift from her boss) was frozen at the moment she\\'d closed the book.\"Hello?\" she called, thinking she\\'d spied a figure through the murky fog. \"Hello, can you help me? I think I\\'m dead and I don\\'t know what to do.\"\"Yes, you are. And you don\\'t have to do anything,\" said a disembodied voice. \"You were very polite. You did a good job. But you might have explored a bit more—taken some chances—if you don\\'t mind some feedback.\"\"Anything,\" she answered. \"I\\'ve always believed in revision. Please help me! I\\'m lost.\"And with that, another door, exactly like the one she\\'d entered twelve hours ago, opened out of the murk. \"This way,\" said the voice. And she entered. It was a library of sorts. No people. Just millions and billions of unbound manuscripts.\"Find a better story,\" said the voice, and with a hollow metal clang the door swung shut.©2005, 2020 Betsy Robinson, published in Girl Stories & Game Plays: An Anthology of Stories and Plays, 2nd ed._____________*More on Allen Ginsberg\\'s poem \"Howl\" in this morning\\'s (3/26/21) Book News by Ron Charles (some editor really should have told Matt Haig to find another title):A newly discovered original draft of “Howl,” by Allen GinsbergSixty-four years ago this week, customs officials seized 520 copies of an “obscene” poem published in England. Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl” couldn’t have asked for a better marketing campaign. With the help of the ACLU, Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti fought back. The rest is literary history. But that history and that poem have suddenly returned in a most unexpected way. Rare book dealer and Beats specialist Brian Cassidy has found a previously unknown original draft of “Howl.” This uncorrected carbon typescript is believed to be the very one Ginsberg used when he read the poem at Reed College in early 1956 — at least a year before “Howl” became the anthem of the counterculture revolution. Coincidentally, a long-lost recording of that Reed College reading — the earliest audio version of “Howl” — will be released next week (listen to a sample).Originally titled “Howl for Carl Solomon,” Ginsberg’s masterpiece went through considerable revision before it was published in 1956 by Ferlinghetti in “Howl and Other Poems” (story). That complex publishing history and the poem’s prominence make this 11-page unrevised version particularly valuable to scholars of 20th-century poetry. “To say that finding an original previously unknown draft of a major American work of literature is unusual is certainly an understatement,” Cassidy said in a statement. “And given that \\'Howl\\' was famous pretty much from its inception, that an original typescript for it could have been unknown for this long . . . I was just blown away.\"For anyone “burning their money in wastebaskets,” Cassidy is offering to sell this copy of “Howl” for $425,000 (add to cart). ...more ‘Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’  This was one of my most anticipated reads of the year.

It had me at ‘library that contains an infinite number of books’. Then there’s my mild obsession with all things multiverse and my knowing that there isn’t a version of me that doesn’t end up reading this book. I was so hyped up about this book that I preordered three different versions of it. (Sorry, bank account …)What I didn’t expect was to come to the realisation that I didn’t actually like Nora. It took almost no time at all for me to begin resenting her for squandering her potential. She was intelligent and gifted in various disciplines but she bailed on multiple opportunities that most people could only dream of having. Even though I also acknowledged and empathised with the pain she’d experienced, it still took a long time for me to stop being distracted by the privilege she took for granted.  ‘Never underestimate the big importance of small things.’  I loved the idea of being able to test drive different versions of the life that could have been, although it did raise some questions for me. Some were addressed in this book but others are still ticking over in my mind.Nora inhabits the bodies of a number of different versions of herself, all living lives that could potentially have been hers. When she returns to the library the other Noras resume their lives. Nora’s actions in a borrowed life could easily result in consequences that would derail an aspect of the life of the Nora that lives there, and I wondered if I would chance that if I was in her place. I’d hate to think that me acting in an unintentionally careless way could have real world consequences for another version of me.If someone who has their own version of the Midnight Library chooses to stay in one of the lives they visit, what happens to the version of themselves who lived there first? Do they die? Swap existences with the interloper? Or is their existence undone entirely? Also, if you remain in another version of your life, could you ever truly feel like you belong or would you constantly feel like you need to fake knowing people that weren’t a part of your original life?I did eventually get over my initial resentment/envy of Nora’s many opportunities and settled into exploring each new possible life with her. There were some lives I wanted to visit longer and others I wanted to escape from almost immediately. It seemed obvious from early on where Nora’s story was leading. One thing that I hadn’t given much thought to in the context of this story prior to reading it was the impact that Nora’s choices in life, big and small, would have on the other people in her life. In this respect it reminded me of The Butterfly Effect, although Nora’s story is nowhere near as dark as Evan’s. Paulo Coelho’s Veronika Decides to Die and Robert Frost’s The Road Not Taken also popped into my mind as I was reading.I wound up thinking a lot about who my Mrs Elm would be and the form that my Midnight Library would take. While my Library would have books (obviously!), I’m still not entirely sure who my Mrs Elm is. I don’t know if it’s possible to read this book without thinking about your own regrets. Equally, I don’t know if it’s possible to read this book without considering the changes you could make in your life to erase them.The story is told quite simply. It seemed to me to be part cautionary tale, part self help book and part Philosophy 101.  ‘Now go on, live, while you still have the chance.’  Content warnings include (view spoiler)[alcoholism, death by suicide, grief, mental health, self harm, suicidal ideation and attempt (hide spoiler)].Blog - https://schizanthusnerd.com[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]> ...more Thank you Matt Haig for such a magical carpet ride!

The Midnight Library is the place between life and death where individual variants of life stories can be found and pursued.Nora Seed, the book’s protagonist, is given this opportunity. She is 35 and feels that her life is going nowhere. She has recently canceled her upcoming marriage. She finds herself estranged from her brother and her best friend, and her parents are deceased. Nora feels isolated and depressed, and then to top everything off, she loses her job, and her cat dies. She decides she no longer wants to live. After taking an overdose of anti-depressants, she finds herself in the Midnight Library. Nora then enters her fantasy lives. She is an Olympic swimmer, rock star, a glaciologist in the Arctic Circle, professor of philosophy at Cambridge, wife, mother, etc. The author follows her through these lives, none of which is fully satisfying.Having been raised on the Wizard of Oz, I had a pretty good idea where the book was going early on. However, this predictably wasn’t the book’s only problem. Nora’s self-revelations feel more like something out of the self-help genre than literary fiction. That said these revelations are valid and I can see why the book resonates with so many people during these troubled times. ...more The Midnight Library by Matt HaigTHE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY was a quick and engaging read.

I haven\\'t read that book but this one is a beautifully imagined foray into what makes life liveable and every human being\\'s quest for that mostly elusive \\'perfect\\' life.We have all thought back to those moments in our lives when we could have made different choices and wondered how our lives would have turned out if we had. Nora Seed, struggling to survive, alone, jobless, having lost her cat and estranged from her best friend and brother, gets to explore this possibility for real. At her lowest point, she ends up in the midnight library which has every life she could have ever lived with every choice she could have ever made. What\\'s more, it has a list of all the regrets she has ever had - of not continuing with her brother\\'s band, not studying philosophy, giving up swimming, never fulfilling her dream of being a glaciologist, messing up personal relationships and many many more.Now she has the chance to choose any of those lives and see which one she would be happiest living. And she does, going through a plethora of choices, being transported into the middle of various existences that are both similar and different from each other, depending on decisions she made.The question is what constitutes perfection. Would any choice we make guarantee no regrets and permanent happiness? Any path of life has good and bad in it and only we can make the most of it, no matter which one we choose. While it\\'s always tempting to believe that in a parallel universe, having done different things, we would have been successful, achieved all our dreams and led wonderful lives, there is a reason why we are in the present. Our current journey has relevance for us and everyone who accompanies us on it.Nora\\'s thoughts during this unexpected opportunity she is afforded resonated very much. I couldn\\'t help relating to her confusion and fear of committing to any of the alternatives she glimpses! What if there was a better option? And besides, can there be an existence that most closely resembles the utopia we hope for?For me, the most important message of this story is that there are tradeoffs for every choice made and many times, it is the small things that matter much more than we give them credit for. Also, the desire to change things not dependent on our own decisions is at the root of many regrets. Once we embrace this idea,our best life may be closer than we think! ...more “It is easy to mourn the lives we aren\\'t living.

It\\'s about having faith and believing and about being clear about what you want, and also about the difference between need and want. Afterwards I felt (and continue to be) inspired to change my perception of existence and reality, to think more about the choices I have made and to think about future choices I will have to make which will not only affect me but others I care about too, and to wonder what the other different versions of me are doing right now..The Midnight Library was powerful, lyrical at times and a fascinating exploration of what it is to be alive.

The fact that Matt Haig could layer so many important concepts in one book and then turn it forward towards the reader in an incredibly obvious way that didn\\'t feel like a trick and remained continuously compelling from the first page to the last is really great writing. It makes me see Matt Haig in a whole new light. He\\'s a quiet genius. The Midnight Library finds us with our main character, Nora Seed, at her lowest point — her dark night of the soul, if you will. Magically, she enters this library with thousands and thousands of books on a conveyor belt, books that allow her (and us) to jump in and out of different lives - all belonging to her. It\\'s quite the ride and you never know where it\\'s going to take Nora (or you as the reader), but it\\'s more than that. Much more than that. There is so much to learn in The Midnight Library. There\\'s so much to understand and experience if you give yourself over to the experience. You start to realize that nothing is as it seems. Nor should it be. You also realize that living is a choice you make based on your reality, but your reality is much more than the one dimension you see, especially if you are caught up in a lot of noise or a lot of silence. All in all, I loved this book. I loved every page of this book. There were a few moments that seemed to drag on and I can tell that the author got a little carried away in certain spots, but it was well worth the read for the simple way it integrated psychology, philosophy and counseling into this crazy time-traveling type story. I feel that some could read The Midnight Library and definitely be unfazed by it and not see the uniqueness contained therein. However, I also feel like those who can ignore the vision that Matt Haig is trying to set for the reader probably has never had a reason to pick up a book by Matt Haig in the first place.

The Midnight Library has found a special place in my heart and I will tell everyone about it and pass on the beauty of this story. This is now the second time I\\'ve read this within four months and this is still the emotional impact that it has, if not more. The love and detail that is placed into this story really lets me know that there is a lot of love and care that went into this story to reach people like me and I appreciate that. Haig went through each story that Nora goes through with such care and detail. This is a story that really encourages someone to keep going no matter what is going on. This is one of those stories that I loved and want everyone to read, but I don’t know how to properly put my love and emotion from this story into words to explain to others why they should read it. Not only that, I feel like this is a hard story to talk about without spoiling the whole thing. So please, take my word for it and read this book. Put some blind faith in me and pick up this book.

In the middle of a possible suicide, Nora suddenly wakes in a library. For Nora this was her home base, with a dear old friend Mrs. Elm as her guide. And this Midnight Library was full of books, more than the eye could see. And each book was a different version of her life. She only had to pick and she was able to spend time living those various alternate lives - lives she might have had, had she made a different decision, altered her actions. But what was Nora looking for in all those lives - what was she missing in her root life? I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There are books that come to us at just the right time in our life. For me, this was one of those books. The authors use of magical realism was, in my opinion, the best part of this book. He took a real feeling, a well known context, and molded it into a possibility.

After all, we all wonder, don\\'t we, what our lives might look like now if we\\'d turned left instead of right...if this thing had happened but not that thing...Of course, a novel like this is all about the journey. And as for the journey, I enjoyed every second of it. It\\'s always fun seeing what could have been. What if, what if, what if? And we get a lot of those.It\\'s all about regrets.

Make all those other choices. That\\'s it, really. Best of all possible worlds.The Midnight Library is a place between life and death. This place will determine if you want to live or have no hope for life in the end. It goes into different life dimensions, the regrets, and all the possibilities that we could have had in a single life.Caught between life and death, the main protagonist Nora finds herself in a vast library, the books here are stories of her life not lived. Guided by the librarian, who reflects a part of her past, Nora tries on some of those lives for size, a process that changes her understanding of her life in many ways...On a personal note, it definitely served as a reflective tool for me. I think we all from time to time picture how different our lives could’ve been had we have done things differently and taken up different opportunities. This book solidifies the fact that there is nothing you can do about your past, but you have every chance and opportunity for your future. Your life is a continuous blank page and you can change things at any time.The Midnight Library is kind of \"It\\'s A Wonderful Life\" for the modern age, written with the deep insight into certain aspects of the human condition that Matt Haig is known for, beautifully crafted, and offers the reader many thought-provoking ideas. It\\'s a novel you will drift off with into thoughts of your own life decisions, whilst constantly being brought back to Nora and hers.Although the topic of the book was quite heavy, the tone of the book was uplifting and funny therefore made it a very easy read and easier to consume the topics which were being spoken about.I don\\'t think I could profess enough about how much I love this book. It\\'s become a new all-time favorite and I can\\'t thank Matt Haig enough for so perfectly capturing my own mental health issues in a character that is instantly relatable and complicated. ...more \"The only way to learn is to live.\"A Beautiful book which is very easy to read.

We just have to brave enough to seek it. The story was able to raise some questions in my mind, gave me something to think about. Like am I regretting not doing something because I didn\\'t do it or because someone else has expected me to do it? Or how do I define success? Money, fame, happiness, love?? These are the best kinds of stories.\"Death is the opposite of possibilities.\" There are certain loopholes that I also found. For example, what happened to the Nora who was already living in a world when traveling Nora replaces her? When traveling Nora left they came back but in the meantime where were they?Despite its lacking, I loved this book. For no good thing is perfect. Recommending the book to everyone. ...more Nora Seeds decides to die. However, before she does she comes to a middle station, a library.

When I first started this book, I immediately felt quite underwhelmed: it was not following the story I was expecting it to. The premise promised libraries, infinite choices and parallel universes, which made me count on something similar to ‘The Starless Sea’ by Erin Morgenstein. After reading a few chapters, I put it off for 2 months, until one day I decided to give it another chance, which led to me to binge-reading this book in one day. This book was enjoyable, though repetitive at times. I had a fun time reading most of it, so if you’ve been interested in this novel for a while, I can tell you it’s definitely worth a try.What really struck my interest was the idea of this library where you can visit your past regrets and undo them in a parallel universe. I really enjoy seeing this type of concept explored, hence this book pick. I applaud Matt Haig for coming up with this idea and linking it with mental health issues and philosophical questions. The different lives we get to experience along with our main character Nora Seed are diverse, which brings a lot of variety. As a result of these experiences, Nora Seed often learns a new lesson, which gives the reader perspective. For example, after Nora has “undid” a few of her regrets in her parallel lives, she ultimately gets to the conclusion that all this time, she shouldn’t have felt so bad about these regrets. She realizes that she should’ve focused on her current life instead of worrying about the past. Thus, we, as readers, get this life lesson too.Nevertheless, a common risk with this type of concept is predictability. When we follow the main character as she specifically chooses a regret she wants to undo, it is often very easy to predict what will follow. There isn’t a wide variety of plot twists, which led me to predicting most of the plot. That’s the main reason why I was struggling with the book in the beginning as well. However, when you get in the right mood, this book can be quite addicting to read despite this flaw.The main topic of this novel is depression and suicide. Because these are very serious illnesses, I was a bit sceptic about how the author would represent it in his book. When I found out Matt Haig had fought his own battle with depression and anxiety, I was more assured. Generally I found that the main character’s mental health problems were represented quite realistically. Nonetheless, the ending disappointed me quite a bit. There isn’t a ‘set’ cure to depression, there are different aspects to getting better. Simply deleting your regrets will not solve everything, but it did come off that way with this book, which can be disappointing for some people. The mental health representation in this book might be different for every reader, depending on their own experiences and views on life.This book is written in first person, which I believe was the perfect choice. The author took us to Nora Seed’s life changing experience through her eyes, slowly building up everything. Because of Matt Haig’s choice of narrative voice we learn how each experience impacts the main character’s life, which brings things into perspective. However, the author found multiple chances throughout the book to give us a long speech about depression, life and anxiety which comes off very unnatural. An example of this can be found when she lives her life as an Olympic Champion and has to give a TED talk: the author used this opportunity to give a 2-page monologue. Even though it did not bother me that much, it did come off as a self-help book during those scenes which was not what I was expecting.In conclusion, it was an enjoyable read with a fun concept. If the premise sounds like something you might be interested in, I can definitely recommend it. Once I got into this book, it felt like the real world disappeared and I found myself in this fictional world. Even though it might not be everyone’s cup of tea, it definitely brings you some escapism.  ...more I plucked this off a supermarket shelf because it was £4.50 or 2 for £8, so I chucked the latest Billy Connolly paperback into my trolley too and then went off to get my washing powder and bananas.

Matt Haig has been open about his own struggles with poor mental health and has written several novels on this theme. Here, we have a mid-thirties woman succumb to suicidal depression as she feels her life crumbling around her. In between life and death, she finds herself in a huge library which contains books of all the lives she might have lived were she to have made different decisions along the way. Inevitably, it prompts you to think about you own life in this way. Matt Haig has very cleverly woven some important and uplifting insights into a lightly told story. I doubt it would have much impact on anyone in the grip of serious depression but for those brought low by circumstance, or just in a bit of a trough, it may well bring some cheer and comfort. ...more Nora Seed hasn\\'t had the best week, in fact let\\'s just say that she hasn\\'t had the best life.

She wakes up in a library and finds her school librarian, Mrs Elm there and Mrs Elm informs Nora that she is in an in-between place and here she has an infinite number of lives that she could choose from. All she has to do is go through The book of regrets and choose a different life and she\\'ll end up there. If she is disappointed there, she\\'ll come back to the midnight library and she can choose another life.  She stepped outside, wondering whether a life could really be judged from just a few minutes after midnight on a Tuesday. Or maybe that was all you needed. Nora tries life after life but she always ends up not liking it or being a stranger in her own life no matter how popular or how successful or how rich she is and always ends up back at the library. Mrs Elm smiled, wryly. \\'It just shows you, doesn\\'t it?\\'\\'Shows me what?\\'\\'Well, that you can choose choices but not outcomes. But I stand by what I said. It was a good choice. It just wasn\\'t a desired outcome.\\' Then Mrs Elm tells Nora that maybe she should try lives where the regrets weren\\'t obvious. Even after trying those lives and even liking one where she thought that it could be her new life, she still ends up at the midnight library and at last she understands that she won\\'t feel at home in any of her other lives because even though technically all of those are her lives, practically she didn\\'t live them.  Are there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change? She does get fresh perspective through her journey and she also realizes that she wants to live. Never underestimate the big importance of small things. She wakes up in her root life and decides to turn everything around as her perspective has changed. That the prison wasn\\'t the place, but the perspective. She decides to teach piano lessons and also catch up with Mrs Elm even though she doesn\\'t remember Nora and it is not the same Mrs Elm from the midnight library. She also makes up with her brother. May be there was no perfect life for her, but somewhere, surely, there was a life worth living. This was such a great read. I loved the writing and I was engrossed from the very beginning. I didn\\'t like Nora in the beginning but she grew on me and I was rooting for her throughout. I felt her journey like it was my own journey. How many times have I thought of making different decisions but I also know that if I were given the chance all over again, I would still make those exact same decisions because they felt right in my heart at the time.

Matt Haig has the ability to reduce some of life’s most painful, poignant and perhaps personally destructive moments to opportunities for enlightenment - to contrast and instead cast about in the gloom for what it means to be human, perceive that humble role as one filled with meaning and infuse hope where regret is pointless. THE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY, a gentle fable, manages to do all of this in Haig’s gifted hands. Longer reviews than this have described Nora’s anguish, her heartsickness over what has seemed a lifetime of regret and disappointment, of not fulfilling a destiny others charted for her- and eventually, her inability to visualize a future where her presence in this world was worth the oxygen she breathed. The regrets... the tangle of most lives... but, fantastically Nora gets to revisit these in The Midnight Library, and live out parallel lives, discovering herself and others in the process. At its core, this novel is framed around a classic, powerful and much favoured theme of children’s stories- “Home is best”, which resonate strongly, and is such a healing message. Our essential selves can be as simple as that oyster, with meaning for that moment in time. A very special book. Five stars. ...more “The Book Of Disappointments”This book had a promising premise, but the execution wasn’t what I was expecting.

And the library isn’t used as much as I wanted it to, so that’s another disappointment.There are times that you’re like “oh, this life seems nice” but then you look at the page number and see that half of the book is left, so you think “the life must end in a few chapters” and then not care about it or its ‘moral’ at all. The ending was also too happy to be realistic. Sometimes, things won’t get better. I did not hate this book, it was just...fine.

Nora tries on her possible lives through the books in The Midnight Library, and each chapter takes the reader through many of the possibilities.The problem for me is that I loved the idea more than the execution. In the first 25% or so when Nora was going through her various lives, I was feeling optimistic about where the book was going, and I thought that her choices on what to change were done in a realistic way based on the complaints she was making at the beginning. However, I would say that the book really took a turn for me at the point where she tries on a life where she is a glaciologist. I understand that it is virtually impossible for the author to build up and explain in the beginning of the book every single faucet of the main character, but this desire of hers came out of nowhere and was based on nothing. I do realize that perhaps the only reason she had to try on this life was because she met a character in those related chapters who shows up a few times in her other lives, but even that to me seems very far fetched, in addition to his character being kind of unnecessary in general. Not only could I not get over how highly unlikely it would be for her to meet this character multiple times in a universe where she was told she has infinite lives, but I also could not get past the fact that there was no uniformity between these different lives. In every single life Nora tried on, it felt like the core of her being drastically changed, such that the ‘root’ Nora was always out of place. And yes, I understand that life experiences can change people completely, but it felt like she changed a little bit too much; its no wonder she couldn’t get into any of the lives because she couldn’t even recognize herself, ever. This also made me feel disconnected to her character. This was obviously done on purpose to give the reader that predictable ending we know is coming, but I was not a fan.I guess the other main thing that made me feel nothing towards Nora though is the fact that she has absolutely no goal. Her whole thing was that she wanted to be happy, but she has no definition of what that could mean to her. I also really disliked how every single time she jumped into a new life, she found a way to give someone in that life a motivational speech about, “living other lives” or “what I would do in another life” – she brought this up every chapter, and it got old, fast. The book was more about inspirational quotes than actual plot. I love that Matt Haig uses his platform to advocate for mental health, but I’m just confused because the messaging I got from this book was that having a more positive outlook on your life and realizing all the good in what you have can “cure” your depression, when that’s not really the case. I can see why people would like this book - it has a really motivational approach and definitely makes you reflect on your own live and decisions, however, in terms of the actual plot, it just wasn’t for me. ...more I found The Midnight Library an easy, yet engrossing and thought-provoking read.

Every decision she has ever made has spawned a new book, containing the life she might otherwise have lived.Nora now has the opportunity to explore, as many of us have dreamed of doing, those \"parallel\" or \"alternate\" lives in which she maintained her youthful dedication to competitive swimming, overcame her stagefright to perform in a band, moved to the country to open a pub with a former boyfriend, or accepted a neighbour\\'s invitation to coffee.Through these excursions into the lives of her other selves, Nora begins to see certain parallels in her relationships with others, and is surprised to discover, not unexpectedly to the reader, that the grass isn\\'t necessarily greener in those lives where she\\'d taken the various opportunities she regrets having missed in her present life.The Midnight Library is a thoughtful and imaginative book, with a sensitive and, to my mind, accurate depiction of the experience of depressive / anxiety-based illness and the resulting distortions it can create in the lens through which sufferers see their world.Highly recommended to those readers who enjoy stretching their imagination.Trigger warnings: mental illness, attempted suicide. ...more Six stars for the premise.

The premise of the story is that a library exists where there are books that allow Nora, the main character, to live as though she had made an infinite number of different choices, basically undoing her regrets and having a chance to see how her life played out if she had chosen differently. Obviously I don\\'t want to give anything away so it is difficult to review this book without throwing any spoilers. Almost impossible, actually, so I\\'ll say that I expected more humor from this author, as I\\'ve read him in the past. One thing I\\'ve loved about him is he can tackle difficult themes while throwing in enough humor that I remember the book with a smile. This one didn\\'t have much humor at all, but I very much enjoyed it. Again, I don\\'t want to throw spoilers. Let\\'s say that Nora has a chance to choose books, and thus, different lives, and some of those at one point became a bit tiresome for me because of the nature of those different stories. Nora was born with many gifts and talents, as are all of us. Depending upon which of those she chooses to focus on, her life goes in many different directions. A couple of those didn\\'t interest me much. And that\\'s where the book became tiresome for me, and why it loses a star. Saying all that though, this is a thought-provoking read, and while some dark themes are covered, including depression, which the author understands well because he\\'s been there, it ends on a high note. It is definitely worth your time and would make a great book club discussion read. We have all had events or decisions that we would either undo or change the timing of, and it is fascinating to explore that. If that sounds interesting to you, then you would enjoy this book!ETA: I want to add that the audio version was well done too. It for me was also a four star performance.My favorite quote from the book: Never underestimate the big importance of small things. ...more THE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY was such a clever and engaging concept.

There was no prettying up of the experience, it was raw and gritty. I felt for Nora, even though she wasn’t overly likeable at the beginning. Nora definitely grew on me along the way.Nora went through her social media. No messages, no comments, no new followers, no friend requests. She was antimatter, with added self pity.No way am I going to spoil for you what the midnight library was but when it was revealed to me as a reader, I literally felt delighted at the concept. It was fresh and unique but also, I believed in the idea of it, for this story. The stories within the story were all about possiblity, the what ifs, the second guesses, the fantasies and the maybes; it was hard to look up from the page.Did I have a favourite possiblity or character? Maybe but I think I always knew where it was going to end and that felt just right.Matt Haig has told a wonderful story through fiction, maintaining his reign as the best mental health advocate out there. No patronising, no assuming, just real and kind. Highly recommended and I’m sure this book will have wide appeal.Howl, into the night,Howl, until the light,Howl, your turn to fight,Howl, just make it right.Thank you to Canongate Books for the early review copy.This review can be found on A Take From Two Cities Blog. ...more 2.5*s.

She\\'s alone and directionless and regrets almost every decision she\\'s ever made. When, one day, she decides to end it all, she finds herself between life and death in a library, its books filled with all the lives she could have lived. She can try any of them or all of them and when she finds the perfect life she can choose to stay. But is any life ever really perfect?\"Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”This book was not subtle in its messaging - in fact, at times I felt I was being beaten over the head with it. Life is what you make of it. Regrets are pointless. There\\'s no such thing as perfection. It\\'s all about perspective. And on and on. Each new life - and we live hundreds with Nora - brings a new \\'lesson\\'. None new, none particularly skilfully imparted.

The fact that the character’s depression and mental health issues followed them, no matter which path they chose, was both relatable and a little sad to me.

It also had the phenomena of a parallel universe. The author had a lot of information about the philosophy and he also mentioned interesting facts quite often too.

I really didn’t enjoy this book.To me, it seemed obvious, immature and full of cliches. Contemporary magic realism is not for me.

The fact that The Midnight Library won the GoodReads Choice Awards for 2020 Best Fiction probably had a lot to do with it. I figured maybe the last book was a fluke… Also, the premise sounded very interesting. We are talking about a never-ending library, with infinite number of books in it!!! I mean I thought what’s not to like? Ummm, as it turned out, A LOT!This is the story of Nora Seed, a 35-year-old woman who suffers from depression and is living a life full of regrets, full of missed opportunities. An acquaintance she runs into tells her, she doesn’t actually have stage fright; she has life fright. She takes her own life, and enters the Midnight Library. A place where all her alternate lives are presented to her in the form of infinite books. She can pick any up, enter it and live a different life, if she finds that life disappointing, she can come back and try again. If she finds a life she’s happy in, she gets to stay and live it.This premise does have potential. There is a lot that can be done with the parallel universes concept. There is a lot that HAS been done and done WELL with the parallel universes concept. But speaking of “missed opportunities”, Matt Haig’s execution of this premise is very very poor. First of all, this book is painfully predictable. I think at about 25% (within the first couple of visits to the first couple of parallel lives) I knew exactly where the story was going. Then I went on to hope that I’m wrong. I hoped that it wouldn’t be THAT obvious and heavy-handed and hallmark-movie like, and surely the book is not trying to say exactly what the classic 1946 Christmas movie I had JUST watched the week before during the holidays said but much better 75 years ago (you know I’m talking about “It’s a Wonderful Life”, right?). So imagine the compounding disappointment as chapter after chapter we approached the mind numbingly obvious and much over-taught life lesson that has been done a million times already.Secondly, the book was repetitive and boring, and not just because you already guessed the destination, but unfortunately the journey itself, as we follow Nora from book to book, life to life. During the first 2/3rd of the book, each parallel life takes a chapter or two to go through, and that was boring enough, but at some point, as if to make sure we hadn’t missed the painfully obvious point being made, we go through a dizzying chapter where each of the lives Nora enters is introduced in one line, then one phrase, each life more random and meaningless than the last. And as one happens after another, after another, it dawned on me, I just don’t care! I don’t care what she chooses, I don’t care what happens to her, I just care about how many chapters are left!Third, apparently this author has never heard of “Show, don’t tell”! I mean his attempts at teaching us exactly what the life lessons are and ensuring that we’ve really got them by taking a mallet and hitting us repeatedly over the head with it, got embarrassing after a while. Even for a self-help book disguised as fiction! I mean one of the last chapters of the book is literally titled: ”A Thing I Have Learned (Written by A Nobody Who Has Been Everybody)”. I mean, are you kidding me?This chapter reminded me of an equally embarrassing chapter in The Humans titled: ”Advice for a Human” which had 97 bullet points of advice about how to live! And that chapter also came at the end of the book. Dear Matt Haig, I don’t know how to tell you this, I feel like I need to repeat it 50 times here, because I don’t think you’re a strong believer of people hearing one another when something is said once or twice, but please believe me when I tell you: WE GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!! We got it the first time, then again the second time, then the third… Now when I say I get it, it doesn’t mean I agree. Or that the life lessons are meaningful. There were quite a few fundamental flaws here. Let’s get into them (spoilers ahead):Let’s start with the mechanics of the Midnight Library. The whole concept of the library detecting when Nora experiences disappointment in a life she has entered, and catapulting her back to the library in order to try a different life made no sense. The setup alone guarantees failure time after time. Because the mind numbingly obvious thing here is that there is no life where there exists not one single moment of disappointment. I mean are there people out there that don’t know that?! However, there are some lives where there are small and fleeting disappointments and the person is able to bounce back from them easily, and then there are other lives that the disappointments are so large, so crippling, that they appear to be gripping the person every moment of every day. So I don’t understand this concept of “if you feel disappointment, then you’re taken out of a life”. Of course, if that’s the case, then the library is nothing like what it was advertised. It isn’t actually there to allow you to go back, make a different decision and live another life. It’s just a television that allows you to watch snippets of your other lives, in an attempt to get you to love what you already have. I mean, specifically, in this story, Nora finds a life she loves, a life she doesn’t want to let go, and then she’s yanked out of it anyway. So ummm, is this library a fraud then? See what I mean about poor execution of an interesting concept? I felt like the author was so adamantly focusing on proving that “we should love our lives with whatever disappointments in them, because there is no life that doesn’t have any”, that he forgot the point of lives only being meaningful when we have free will to live them. If Nora was given the choice of if/when to exit a life, then it could have been something more logical…Another issue I had with the way the Midnight Library was set up was that there was no incentive to actually try and commit to a life, when in the back of your mind you know that there are an endless number of lives waiting for you to jump in or out of, at any time. How do you ever commit to stay in one life forever, when you know an infinite number of options are calling your name? Again, I thought it was a much too obvious attempt to set up Nora for failure… To make it so that she would arrive at the heavy-handed conclusion that none of the endless options are the one she wants except the one she already had. It was just very manipulative.And obviously, the grand life lesson here of course is that the life you hated so much that you decided to end is actually… ahem… “A Wonderful Life”. But there was a crap load of other life lessons in this book, most of which I found quite nonsensical.For example, one life lesson I didn’t agree with or appreciate: as Nora hops from one parallel life to the next, she discovers that in some she has achieved big success, from being an Olympic gold medalist, to being a very famous Rock Star, to a professor at Cambridge University, to a great scientist, to a CEO, she experiences them all, and guess what, every single life is a no go. They’re all different shades of “disappointing”. And why? Well, apparently because every single regret she has in life, every time she goes back to a fork in the road and takes the other path to undo a regret, she discovers that none of the things she supposedly missed out on were her dreams. They were all other people’s dreams. It was her dad that wanted her to be an Olympian, it was her brother who wanted her to be a musician, it was her fiancé who wanted her to be a pub owner in the country, it was her friend who wanted her to live in Australia, heck, it was the school librarian who dared to open her mouth and suggest to her that perhaps she could use that brain of hers and study science and become a glaciologist. And why did these horrible people dare to suggest to a young impressionable girl what to be? Ummm could it be because she was good at swimming? Good at music? Good at science? Ummm could it be that literally that is the point of parents, family, friends, and teachers? To guide us? Help us discover our potentials? And support us as we cultivate them?Then we go on to experience lives where Nora pursues the paths their “guidance” put her on to discover, obviously, that those lives are miserable anyway, because they were not her dreams she was living, but someone else’s. Ok, sure, but are we forgetting that the life where she didn’t pursue their dreams and instead decided to pursue her own dreams (wait, did she have any?) didn’t turn out so hot either? I’m sorry but what BS life lesson is this? Also, I’m just sick and tired of reading book after book where the life lesson is that the alternate life in which you’re a go-getter, where you’re more successful, fitter, richer, more educated, looked up to, admired, etc. is all just smokes and mirror and in reality in those lives you’re miserable, because “that’s the price of success”? Misery is the price you must pay. Ummm, no. Maybe this concept sells books, as most of us are average Joe’s and we like to hear that the others, those who achieved things we didn’t, secretly wish for our lives, just as we wish for theirs, and yes, I have heard of the saying “Grass is always greener…” but honestly dude, whatever helps you sleep at night! And apparently, whatever helps you sell lots of books!I would really like to read a book where we acknowledge that there are people who actually do have it all, ambition, extreme level of success, as well as happiness, love, family, adoration. And there are also people who make all the right decisions and try very hard, and yet don’t achieve the level of success they “deserve”. It is not pick one or the other. Success or love/happiness is not some fork in the road. There are people who have both. There are people who have neither. That is the reality of this world. There is a level of “the luck of the draw” that is simply at play as well. I’m certainly not saying you don’t have free will to make things happen for yourself and that you’re born to be successful or happy or not , but I am saying this is a very complex concept. There are so many moving pieces at play. The country you’re born in, the family you’re born in, your level of health and abilities, as well as your attitude, your lifestyle, your ambition, AND your mistakes, they’re all playing a part. This is an endlessly complex concept that this book was not even able to scratch the surface of!A final life lesson that I also had a big problem with: The book is appearing to have this “important” message that if you change your perspective, all the ugliness you were seeing can start to look beautiful. A life you wanted to end one day becomes a life of endless possibilities you cannot wait to go back to. You will literally run through a building on fire, with the roof caving in on your head, to get another crack at it. And you’ll soon wonder why you couldn’t see it all before!“She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”This whole idea of “change your perspective, chin up girl, the world is beautiful if you just stop to smell the roses”, is a very inappropriate form of messaging in regards to depression. I’m not an expert, but I do know enough to at least acknowledge that depression is a mental health condition. It is a disease. It requires treatment. It is not enough to “get perspective” and “see life’s potential”. No, you cannot shake it off. Before you remind me that the author himself had depression for a time, let me tell you that I know that already, and that’s why I’m even more flabbergasted by this type of messaging.To be honest with you, the only thing this book had going for it was that it was relatively short. I do NOT recommend this book, and next time my bookclub tries to vote for one of his books, I’m gonna put my foot down! ...more before i start with the actual review can i just say that i am confused about why this is a „fiction“ book instead of „fantasy“ or at least „magical realism“ and was the winner for fiction for the goodreads award?!because let’s face it 4/5th of the book is pure fantastical thinking.i do not understand how genres are decided on goodreads at all!TRIGGER WARNING: before i get into the actually review, let me just mention that the start of this book could be very triggering for people that have thou before i start with the actual review can i just say that i am confused about why this is a „fiction“ book instead of „fantasy“ or at least „magical realism“ and was the winner for fiction for the goodreads award?!because let’s face it 4/5th of the book is pure fantastical thinking.i do not understand how genres are decided on goodreads at all!TRIGGER WARNING: before i get into the actually review, let me just mention that the start of this book could be very triggering for people that have thoughts about self-harm or struggle with that topic, because its pretty descriptive in that and also shows a lot of negative and what i call ugly thinking of putting yourself down. And while some of those things - the negative thoughts mostly- are addressed throughout the book, the actual self-harm and trying to take your life is never addressed in a good way, in my option. Its basically just \"solved\" by the lessons learned in the lifes. But its never discussed that you should seek help, talk to someone and try to find someone to help yourself. That being said, Haig did write this book in a readable and light tone, so once you get over those first few moments, it gets lighter. And those moments are pretty fun and interesting and different and had a lovely plot idea and overall some good messages and little quotable sayings in it.it shares a lot of truth about most of not all peoples life’s. it mentions a good amount of people can be struggling but in ways nobody else sees.i also love how there is a lot of empathizes made on how small changes can make a big impact and that dreams or hopes or wishes might not always be what we always dreamed them up to be.it’s just a good book full of wonderful sentiments that, yes sure, are nothing new at all but are still nice to hear or read and be reminded of every once in a while.i also absolutely love that the main character is in her thirties and still trying to figure out life - it’s not something that just happens once you reach this magic age number! you can still try to find yourself at any age even if other people don’t understand that or pretend to not understand it or even pretend that they have it together themselves when really they don’t.  if you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. aim to be you. aim to look and act and think like you. aim to be the truest version of you. embrace that you-ness. endorse it. love it. work hard at it. and don’t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it. most gossip is envy in disguise. keep your head down. keep your stamina up. keep swimming. i also liked how this book discusses dealing with expectations.how we are constantly bombarded with other peoples hopes and dreams and wishes and being pushed and pulled into those directions.from childhood on parents maybe even unconsciously push kids into specific directions or out of specific directions.and that really does impact people. it was nice to see it mentions that sometimes finding what YOU really want is very hard because sometimes that want has never played a role or was always quieted or drowned out by the noice of other people. prison wasn’t the place, it the perspective. what i didn’t enjoy so much, was the we spend very little time actually getting to know the main character and get actual life and how she got to the point she ist at that she tries to take her own life and ends up in the Library. The book starts with her thinking about killing herself and really starts when she does and lands in the midnight library.i wish we would have gotten a bit more then the negatively shaded few pages of her actual life to really understand the character better. the book worked without that but i can see people struggling with just being dumped into the hardest part of a characters life and then going straight into the jumping into other life options.i also had issues with the actual life jumping.why would you be dumped into a life without also getting the knowledges needed for that life?! of course you won’t be happy in the life you have no clue how to live! you can’t possibly be a scientist if you have no clue how to do that! you need that knowledge!so why would the library dump someone into the body of that life but not give the memories as well so that the life makes sense?it would also show that every life has struggles and issues and might seem perfect at the first glance but it was still hard work.everything in this book would have worked just as well of the character would have to get used to the lives but with background knowledge of each of the lives!it just bothered me because it was so clearly plotted to make the ending the book so overly clear (view spoiler)[ because of course you want to go back to what you know and try to change that for the better instead of trying to learn for example years of university knowledge over a few weeks while in the middle of nowhere because you are in the middle of an experiment where you need that learned knowledge but don’t have it! that too hard and not possible! and i felt like every life she tried she lacked the information that would help her actually make a real decision if that life would suit her better if she had info’s about that life and how she got there. but without it? nothing makes sense it’s hard and uncomfortable and why would you literally choose the life of a stranger that makes no sense?  (hide spoiler)]so i wish that would been done better and more written in a way that it would have been a real choice between different options and not rigged to make it very hard to basically impossible for most lives seen in this book.And as i already mentioned in the warning at the beginning of the book, i wish the actual suicide would have been addressed. Nora tried to kill herself and was very close to actually killing herself. But its never mentioned that there are options and help available. That she needs help afterwards too, that she can\\'t just go home and never think about having tried to kill herself, but should seek out help in some way. Its great that the Library gave her back her will to live, but you need more if you are depressed and suicidal! And i think that should have been addressed more. Its a book about that topic, that actively shows self harm, so it should also talk about what can help to not go there.and after all that complaining:i do really think this book so well done and well written.i liked the aspects of this place “in between” where one person that had a big impact on your life is once again there to help you when you need it most. i think that most reads will get some enjoyment out of it and have a good time reading it. so definitely worth a try if you are not triggered by the topic! ...more Unable to endure life any more, Nora Seed takes an overdose, and finds herself in the Midnight Library - a place between life and death, where she has the chance to undo her regrets and live multiple other lives that she could have lived had she made different decisions in her root life.

What for instance if she had not given up swimming, or had pursued her one time dream of being in a band, or what if she had not broken off her engagement to Dan? With the help of Mrs Elm, her former school librarian, Nora finds herself trying out some of these different lives, however, will she find a life she actually wants to live?I absolutely loved the concept of this book. I\\'m sure everyone of us has at some point wondered what if I had chosen that path instead, that idea of the \\'grass is always greener\\'. This book takes that concept and runs with it. It also tackles some really important and weighty issues in relation to mental health, a subject matter that I understand the author has personal experience of and has drawn inspiration from in other works too. Given the subject matter, the beginning of the book does have quite a dreary feel to it, and some readers might find it upsetting. Personally, I think Haig approaches the book with quite a light, almost whimsical writing style, which for me ensured the book never felt too dark and made it quite an easy read. On the downside though, I did find that the writing style perhaps added to the emotional disconnect that I had a problem with throughout the book, and which I will elaborate on further later in the review.One of the things I personally thought was conveyed really well in the first section of the book before Nora takes the overdose, is how Haig makes it clear that Nora feels she is of no worth to anyone. Having experience of working in mental health, one of the things that health professionals always explore, is \\'protective factors\\' i.e. what is there that might stop someone going though with any suicidal thoughts? Whilst thoughts of family and loved ones is the most commonly identified factor, pets are often another, in that they give people a sense of responsibility and being needed and Haig highlighted that really well I thought, in that Nora felt without her cat and without the neighbour needing her to do his weekly shop, there wasn\\'t anyone she had any responsibility towards, there wasn\\'t anyone she thought needed her. I liked how Haig also came back to this idea towards the end of the story, as in another life, Nora realises that without her help her neighbour ends up in a residential home, and that she was actually instrumental in helping him keep his independence. Likewise, one of the young boys she tutors in her root life, in another life without this, ends up getting into trouble with the law, again highlighting the positive impact she was having on someone without truly realizing it. I liked this idea of how our lives interconnect with other peoples\\' in a myriad different ways, and that sometimes small things we do, may have more impact then we realize. I liked how the book explores how we can set up our expectations of ourselves to be too high, and also how we often base this on other peoples\\' expectations of us. Particularly in a modern society where social media plays such an important role in many peoples\\' lives, people can place huge pressures on themselves, which can affect their mental wellbeing. One of the things Nora realizes as the story goes on and she tries out these different lives, is that quite often the things she didn\\'t pursue and thought she regretted weren\\'t actually her own dreams, but other peoples\\' dreams, but that in not having taken them up she was weighed down in guilt. Yet when she lived the lives where she pursued these dreams, they didn\\'t make her happy and so those regrets she had been carrying melted away. The book also highlights how ultimately it is our own perceptions of life that is the most important thing, as life itself is never going to be perfect, but one has to find and draw on the positives before us.I did find that the endless lives Nora takes up became somewhat repetitive and predictable in terms of knowing that Nora would eventually become unhappy in them. Also so much of the book is taken up with Nora living out different versions of herself, that it makes it harder to appreciate the \\'true\\' Nora and to connect to her. For me, this is where I struggled with the book, in that I never connected to Nora, hard as I tried to. I think this was probably down to a combination of things, including the writing style as mentioned earlier, as well as there being too many versions of Nora, and that she seemed to be defined more by what she did in any particular life rather than just who she was as a person herself. Nor were there any secondary characters that I felt connected to or emotionally invested in, as again they either change too much between lives, or just aren\\'t developed enough as characters e.g. Ash or Nora\\'s brother.Also I appreciate the idea of us having endless possibility within us, but the fact that so many of Nora\\'s lives were so extraordinary e.g. being a popstar, or an Olympic athlete, was just a tad unrealistic. And whilst I appreciate the book by its very nature is not exactly based in realism, (though actually Haig did try to allude to quantum physics with regards to the whole idea of multiverses), I just thought Nora\\'s lives didn\\'t need to be so extreme. Of course there are more ordinary versions of her life that we also see, and actually the one she is the happiest in for longest, is not necessarily the one where she is the richest or most successful, but the one in which feels loved and loves in turn, which I liked.Overall, I was more impressed by the concepts behind the book rather than the execution, and for me personally, it didn\\'t quite live up to all the rave reviews I had read. Still I appreciated the life lessons to be learned from the book, even if I thought they perhaps could have been more subtly presented. ...more Martie\\'s Rating: Three and a half starsGenre: Literary/Women’s FictionPublisher: Penguin Random HousePub.

Date: Feb. 11, 2021For someone who loves to read in the wee hours of the morning, how could I not want to read a book with the title, “The Midnight Library?” The novel did not disappoint. It reminded me of the film, “It’s a Wonderful Life.” The book is marketed as literary/women’s fiction. This reviewer did not think it was either. It is more of a fantasy and feel-good read. The fact that this is a heartwarming tale is interesting because the novel begins with a young woman who has just overdosed on purpose. She wakes up to find herself not in heaven or hell but an immensely large magical library. Did I mention that she is an avid reader and spent most of her childhood in a library? Yes, there is a connection. It turns out that this library is the place people go when they find themselves dangling between life and death and not entirely sure about which way to go. I get that a religious person would take issue with this concept. However, if you believe in quantum physics and that we live in multiple universes at the same time you will be thrilled to know that there are other believers out there. There is even mention of Schrödinger’s cat. It is okay if you never heard of the cat. It will be explained to you. In this magical library, our protagonist meets a kindly librarian who shows her her very own “book of regrets.” We all have them. Now here comes the fantasy. She jumps into each life where she could make a different choice than she did before and that would lead her to a happier existence. In one life, she is a rock star, in another, she is an Olympic Swimmer. In yet another, she is a happily married wife and mother. Still, she doesn’t care to live any of these better lives because it becomes clear that she doesn’t know what she wants. At first reading her alternate lives were fun. Who hasn’t wished they could jump into another life? But, after a while, it becomes tedious to read one after another. I would have been happier with fewer lives. Still, the author manages to keep the story fun because when the protagonist enters a new life, she knows nothing of it. She must look for herself online and read her social media accounts to know who she exactly is in each particular life, which creates humorous dialogue as we observe her winging it. The author seems to be saying that the universe is full of infinite possibilities, but the story here remains tightly focused on the life of a single woman and all her might-have-been lives. Once you finish the book, or probably before, the moral of the story becomes obvious. “Oh, Auntie Em – there\\'s no place like home!” My only real issue in this tale was thinking about people who lost someone to suicide. How painful it could be reading this fantasy and wishing that their loved one could have also time-traveled to come back to life. This magical tale seems to imply that those who kill themselves and fail to come back to life did not love the people they left behind enough to do so. Overall, it is clear that Haig pushes his readers to ponder his or her own book of regrets, and make us wonder what we can do to keep from making the same mistakes again. He gets her point across very well.

This is probably the book that If I Stay tried and failed to be.

She feels stuck in her current life, full of regrets about her wasted potential.This is beautifully written, as Nora slowly discovers what it means to live life for herself, and whether those other lives she dreamed of would really have been better. It’s a book about regrets and choices, and how Nora could learn to find meaning in her actual life, taking advantage of her potential and how to not take anything for granted. I’ve often struggled with books that jump between different periods of time, much less alternate lives, but Matt Haig did an excellent job here — I felt like Nora was learning something different from each life, and it added so much more meaning to the story. I love the mix of sci fi and some magic, neither of which detracted this from being a deeply profound and insightful book. In summary, this was amazing — I could not put it down and it’s definitely one of the best books I’ve read this year. ...more']"

had a high chance of enjoying it  sadly  i didn t first  it was boring  i listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn t the best  honestly  not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone  it certainly didn t help either that i was listening to eleanor oliphant is completely fine at the same time  in which the narrator was so animated reading the book i also found all of nora s revelations and enlightenment typical  like sure i already know that  the ending was also painfully predictable from the start  so when you can guess where the book is going  everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore  especially if you don t care about the main character  unfortunately  i found nora dull  she wasn t interesting as the main character and i couldn t relate nor care about her luckily  the book was short  i also didn t hate anything about it  hence the   star rating  but at the same time  i can t name anything i liked  maybe one the lives in particular was more interesting than the rest because of the two characters we met and   the concept  it didn t help that the book got repetitive sometimes  the premise was much more promising than the book itself  many liked the midnight library  however  so it might be more of a  me and not you  kind of book  but let me tell you this  if you don t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories  don t read this novel  don t be fooled with  library  midnight library  boooooks   the library is just more of a metaphor  most of the events of this book take place in the real world  and unless you re interested in kind of self help books  or motivational ones   don t read this novel either  because it s more about what nora discovered about herself and life  of course  by dealing with trying to escape from her regrets but then again  the majority liked this book so you might too and it s simply not my cup of tea     more okay  picture this  you are about to bite into a cookie  a big  warm

book a few days ago and i haven t been able to stop thinking about it  it has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book  where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn t see the point of life  but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life  this book was so beautifully written and i love the way this book asks the question  what is the best way to live  between life and death there is a library  and within that library  the shelves go on forever  every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be if you had made other choices  would you have done anything different  if you had the chance to undo your regrets  it s a really cool concept  that between life and death you enter the midnight library  where you get the opportunity to see how your life would ve been different had you made different decisions  i think a lot about this  what my life would be like had i made different choices and wondering if i m the happiest version of myself  this book forces you to ask hard questions  like what makes a life worth living  and are your dreams for yourself really something you want  i love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life   a person was like a city  you couldn t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole  there may be bits you don t like  a few dodgy side streets and suburbs  but the good stuff makes it worth while  matt haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes i m obsessed with in this book  much like the humans  one of my all time favorites  this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be  but i feel like this book is much more serious than the humans  there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book  and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book  where as the humans feels a lot more light hearted and hilarious    it is easy to mourn the lives we aren t living  easy to wish we d developed other other talents  said yes to different offers  easy to wish we d worked harder  loved better  handled our finances more astutely  been more popular  stayed in the band  gone to australia  said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga  it takes no effort to miss the friends we didn t make and the work we didn t do the people we didn t do and the people we didn t marry and the children we didn t have  it is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people  and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be  it is easy to regret  and keep regretting  ad infinitum  until our time runs out  but it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem  it is the regret itself  it s the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people s worst enemy  we can t tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse  those lives are happening  it is true  but you are happening as well  and that is the happening we have to focus on   but god damn  i loved this book  i cried a lot at the end  i ll

take a look at the shelves and every book is her  well  a version of her  other lives that she could ve lived  decisions and paths she could ve pursued if you could undo any and all  bad  decisions you make  would you in short  this book was amazing  really  truly i struggled to write my summary cause i didn t want to give too much away   so much of my joy of this book comes from just discovering where this story led the world building and the writing were phenomenal  it felt like i was marking a new quote on every page cause so much of it was that good nora s character felt so real and she got me all teary so many times  i loved the ethereal magic of the midnight library and the various mind bending scenarios that nora went through  all in all   this book was amazing and i

that i can do so much in my life at the moment and learn what i could have done from the things that happened instead of regretting about it  a must read  it will make you want to have a hard look at your life and make you think about the many unimportant things that you ve been worrying about all your life and instead make you want to focus on the things that really matter a sci fi  fantasy

the pace increases  i am in constant search of the  fictive dream   where i get buried in the story and the rest of my world falls away  the structure of this book  the constant shifting from life to

cold hearted for not loving this  i assure you  i m not  normally  i love sappy  cheesy  inspirational mush  i watch hallmark movies  i believe in soulmates and happily ever after  i cry during every sweet scene in every movie  and yet this book left me so cold inside  and i ll try to put into words why for one thing  this story doesn t come across as fiction so much as self help disguised as fiction  the lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning  yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be understood if explained slowly and repeatedly  we are forced to endure these lessons over and over every time nora goes back to the library  either nora is the most dim witted of characters  or the author thinks us readers are another problem is that it s really hard to connect with nora  she ll take a situation  suck every ounce of joy out of it  and interpret what s left in the most negative way possible  she s full of regret for every decision she s ever made  and thinks the grass is always greener  however  other than being negative  she literally has no other personality traits  she s a blank slate  dull and uninteresting  i also have issues with the core messages in this book  nora finally learns her lesson  but only after having fixated on each regret  remade every decision  and lived all subsequent lives  i m also uncomfortable with the implication that if you re depressed  you only need to change your outlook and you will feel better  that goes against everything we understand about mental illness  including that it s important to seek out professional help  that it can be chemically based  and that it s not a matter of not trying hard enough so many readers loved this book  as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews  but it s just not for me  this is the second book i ve read by matt haig  and i ve had trouble connecting with both  so i think it s time i part ways with this author and just accept that we are not compatible     more i liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self help manual  replete with messages that would look great and profound on an

miserable  but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery   and these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer  i liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self help manual  replete with messages that would look great and profound on an instagram post next to a well posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top  or embroidered on a pillow   pick your poison    she realised that she hadn t tried to end her life because she was miserable  but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery   and these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer  forget the readers figuring it out for themselves   no  the moral and the take home points will be  didactically  in your face  loud and clear  even if it s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks  case in point    as she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to  without condition   some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the hallmark holiday special movie    and   and the thing is   the thing is   what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take  actually isn t  because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement   an olympic medal  the ideal husband  a good salary  and we have all these metrics that we try and reach  when really success isn t something you measure  and life isn t a race you can win   and i m just not big on self help or motivational books  i find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that i just can t take them seriously  it s just me   i guess i don t have the right personality to appreciate them  and so i was not too happy with the turn the story took        the premise was interesting  and the beginning actually had me captivated  it s a story of a woman who s had her final straw   a whole bunch of final straws  really   and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide     maybe she was just really crap at it  at life   she wanted to have a purpose  something to give her a reason to exist  but she had nothing   this may be why so many of even middle aged people like reading young adult books   there s something quite comforting about seeing a brand new person  right at the cusp of adulthood  when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking  and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken  but nora is thirty five  an age considered way too late  especially for women  with that damn idea of a biological clock  to not have it all figured out  it s not the time  at least for women  when the world is considered to be your oyster   it s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together  and nora most certainly does not   well  don t hang about  tick tock tick tock   says a well meaning stranger in that unasked for but nonetheless given bit of advice    when she thought about it   and increasingly she had been thinking about it   nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn t  the things she hadn t been able to become  and there really were quite a lot of things she hadn t become   in that moment between life and death nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had   lives that would have stemmed from one different choice  one different decision   jo walton s quiet gem my real children had a similar premise  and it was wonderful   and the point is   once nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and  perpendicular  lives  she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own the logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down  and nora has quite a few of those   between life and death there is a library   she said   and within that library  the shelves go on for ever  every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be different if you had made other choices   would you have done anything different  if you had the chance to undo your regrets   and then  after a great beginning  which was not always easy to read given how well haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to nora  we careen right into the didactic self help book where each parallel life exists to teach nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don t get it wrong    she realised  in that moment  that she was capable of a lot more than she had known   and if you had any doubts about the ending  doubt no more  it ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self help turn  except it s even more unrealistically saccharine than i even dared to anticipate  it takes a turn into that meaningless  let you be you  drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little  it becomes the cotton candy of advice   sweet but of little value      she didn t need a vineyard or a californian sunset to be happy  she didn t even need a large house and the perfect family  she just needed potential  and she was nothing if not potential  she wondered why she had never seen it before   and all that relentless hammering of the  profound  message into to readers  psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and  honestly  a bit trite    i mean  it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness  and that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness  you can t have one without the other        stars  i did not sign up to read a self help manual but my opinion is decidedly in the minority   maybe i m just a crusty soulless cynic  oh well       you don t have to understand life  you just have to live it  nora shook her head  this was a bit too much for a philosophy graduate to take  it s a bit too much for this science graduate over here  too     more      f a b  bookclub pick   i     f a b  it s incredibly rare that i come across a book that ticks all my boxes  good characters  great

emotional read  reading about a character who is in such a desperate state of mind that they attempt to take their life wasn t easy  but the other side of this book offers a lot of love  warmth  compassion  and healing  it was surprisingly heartwarming and uplifting   nora s story inspired me to turn off the channel of regrets that often fill my head and embrace the here and now i received an

when nora ends up in the midnight library  a sort of limbo between life and death  part  it s a wonderful life  and part  sliding doors   every book in the library represents a parallel universe with a life she could have lived had her choices been different  all she has to do is choose a book and she will automatically be dropped into that life  each time she is dropped into an alternate life  she does so with no prior memory of her life up to that point  she knows she has been dropped in and must wing it and figure out how to fit in seamlessly  there s a bit of humor when she must google herself and check her social media accounts for clues  in one life she thinks she must have been very happy because she wasn t very active on social media  ha  if she loves a life she has a choice to stay  but if she begins to feel disillusioned  she returns to the library  where an infinite number of possibilities awaits  the problem with infinite possibilities is the thought that something better awaits had a different path been chosen each decision life contains unforeseen consequences  some good and some bad  is the grass always greener  it is easy to imagine there are easier paths  but are there  the problem with regrets is they are rarely based on fact  understanding the nuances and importance of our lives are not always obvious i won t ruin the surprise by revealing more of what nora discovers or decides  it s much more fun to discover it on your own  while this book could have been predictable or schmaltzy  the author has written a unique  delightful  and thought provoking story  there are surprises in store and it s impossible to read without reflecting on your own life choices  this was a terrific choice for a buddy read with my friend marialyce  and it would be an excellent choice for a book club i was grateful for the highlighting function on my kindle  as i highlighted a lot  in the midst of a pandemic and social unrest  it s natural to worry about the future  but this book was a good reminder to make the best of this life we ve been given knowing the author has struggled with depression and thoughts of suicide made this book all the more

to a library between the universes with a librarian who is a mental metaphor that can be fathomed only by a few   aisles and aisles of bookshelves  reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor  books were everywhere  the shelves really did seem to go on forever  straight and long to the far off horizon  there were no title and names adorning the spines of the books

live   you don t go to death  but the death comes to you   the fact that the day never ends due to the never ending light is like living one terminal day  it is exceptionally depressing for an already depressed person who decided to die by traveling with her best companion   solitude from a society so lonely owing to the detachment due to the extreme social media attachment does life seem more attractive in the face of death  is death the one that makes life beautiful  is death an obligate parasite that wants to change the relationship to a symbiotic one with life is the simplification of the three dimensional worlds by humans making it more complicated   this is the wrong life  it is really  really  really wrong  take me back  i do want to avenge  take me back to the library in the

this book  i went into this expecting to read about a girl who somehow gets a chance to live multiple lives in several parallel universes  what i got was a lot more than that  i did not expect to be reflecting on some major life lessons and just basically on the way i look at life  none of us have gone not wishing to be able to live our lives differently  wishing we had made different choices  what s important is how you deal with this realization truly appreciate the way the author tackled this so beautifully  i finished this with a big fat smile on my face     more well i definitely have thoughts  rtc in an upcoming  and pretty exciting  vlog  between life and death there is a library  and within that library  the shelves go on for ever  every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be different if you have made other choices   in one word   fascinating  you see  doing one thing differently is very often the same as doing everything differently  actions can t be reversed within a lifetime  however much we try    i cannot help but compare the midnight library with another book maybe    between life and death there is a library  and within that library  the shelves go on for ever  every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be different if you have made other choices   in one word   fascinating  you see  doing one thing differently is very often the same as doing everything differently  actions can t be reversed within a lifetime  however much we try    i cannot help but compare the midnight library with another book maybe in another life  that i have very recently finished reading  i felt that the basic concept in both these books is so similar that tjr might say  mh  you imitated my idea    my response would be that the big difference is the midnight library is written with and for a purpose  that s exactly what the midnight library is about    a purpose  to save a life by making the person realise the importance of being alive  understand the infinite possibilities  and guiding towards giving a perspective and not taking things for granted  all this is done by staying serious yet funny  with genuineness and not being casual the midnight library  which can also be named as  the many lives of nora seed   explores the many lives of a young woman  nora seed  at a time when she has decided to give up her life  and is in fact  in between life and death  matt haig should consider writing this for the big screen and give it to christopher nolan  and christopher will make a masterpiece out of the script     every life contains many millions of decisions  some big  some small  but every time one decision is taken over another  the outcomes differ  an irreversible variation occurs  which in turn leads to further variations  these books are portals to all the lives you could be living      more i absolutely  totally  unequivocally  and ferociously loved this book   who hasn t had regrets   wished they d taken a different path in life  loved more and hated less  studied a little harder  applied themselves a bit more  had more faith in themselves  wished they d liked themselves for who they were instead of what others wanted them to be i m certainly not immune  and i ve actually fulfilled a couple of my life s ambitions  but life is not easy for any of us  as nora was to discover  we all i absolutely  totally  unequivocally  and ferociously loved this book   who hasn t had regrets   wished they d taken a different path in life  loved more and hated less  studied a little harder  applied themselves a bit more  had more faith in themselves  wished they d liked themselves for who they were instead of what others wanted them to be i m certainly not immune  and i ve actually fulfilled a couple of my life s ambitions  but life is not easy for any of us  as nora was to discover  we all  fear life  to some degree   we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences  some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway  many more of us  however  will step back and opt to take the safer road  i loved the notion of nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events  the whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing  imagine if you  too  could examine and then finally burn your own book of regrets and just move on with living your best life now the first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression  if you ve never felt stuck or depressed  you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you ve read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to nora s attempted suicide  there was a history of depression in nora s mother s family  i was not surprised that nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long  protracted illness  death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life  i suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what nora thinks and says in this novel  nora s midnight library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian  mrs  elm  there are several chapters devoted to mrs  elm s struggle to get nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her midnight library  this reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get  unstuck   matt haig has given a whole new meaning to the word  potential   i totally agreed with nora s final decision at the end of the book  in fact  i saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey  we can t live someone else s life  the choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment this author   this book   has a lot to teach us  i am so very glad that i decided to check out what all the hype was about  turns out  all that hype was fully merited   loved every bit of it  including the sad parts  a full five out of five glowing stars for this heart stirring  sanity saving novel  we all need to burn our own book of regrets    and just get on with living our best life now  highly  highly recommended note  i listened to the audiobook version  very ably narrated by the british film actress  carey mulligan                       more     starsi enjoyed

goodness   just stop it  nic cage  i can t take it   slayedand don t even get me started on face off  the rock  leaving las vegas  and  city of angels  holy shit   blissdo i ignore the fact that he is basically insane now and makes any movie that will throw money at him  of course  but who cares  because i will always have the croods  but i digress  let s get back to my super uninformative book review  as i was saying  this book reminded me a lot of the family man and all those other movies  and movies stories like them  that i referenced earlier  it deals with regret and the realization that it s all about perspective  and i really enjoyed that aspect  it s definitely a valuable lesson that has been around for ages  but it s always great to be reminded of it   especially in this age of social media  constant comparison has never been so in your face   all the time   as i said  if not for the ending  i would have really loved this  i really liked molly  and while i didn t necessarily need a blatant hea depicting molly in the future   i would have at least liked nora to end up in a place where we knew molly was probably going to happen  but anyway  that s all i got  i m off to go re watch the family man for the gazillionth time     more in the midnight library  matt haig combines subjects i love in books  life and death concerns  regrets  love  complicated

library wasn t new to me  a couple years ago  there was a canadian tv show called being erica  it wasn t well known nor very popular  but i personally watched each season more than once  it s the story of a woman who travels in the past to erase her regrets  ring a bell  when i learned that matt haig was publishing a book with a similar premise  i was overjoyed i can t say this book is perfect  but it deserves   stars because  well  it is almost perfect     more this is an enjoyable book  it s my first by matt haig  but it won t be my last  it s a book about recognizing all the possibilities of your life  but it s more about letting go the regrets of what you could have been  nora seed is miserable  miserable enough to be not only thinking about suicide  but acting on it  instead of the blackness of death  she awakes in the midnight library accompanied by her elementary school librarian  mrs  elm  mrs  elm explains that the library is filled with books  this is an

elementary school librarian  mrs  elm  mrs  elm explains that the library is filled with books that represent all the possibilities of her life  an infinite number of paths  created by an infinite number of choices  when she chooses a book  she will be transported into the life  and can live it until she decides if it s a life she would want to continue haig writing is strong  clever  clean  and no distractions  the book is full of great observations and insights  a person was like a city  you couldn t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole  there may be bits you don t like  a few dodgy side streets and suburbs  but the good stuff makes it worth while  we get deep into nora s character and she felt genuine in her struggles to me  if anything bothered me about her character it was how talented she was  how many people have the talent to be rockstar  an olympic swimmer  a successful ted talk speaker  etc  etc  however  i can forgive this  as it serves to drive home the central theme of the book my bigger problem is the mechanism that allows nora to revisit her past  a suicide attempt  largely  haig handles this delicate subject well  i appreciate authors that take on subjects as challenging as suicide  but it s dangerous to have the suicide attempt itself be the mechanism that triggers a chance to relive your life  why  because somewhere out there  someone is struggling so hard  that have such regrets  that they will talk themselves into believing anything  i enjoy time travel books and i follow a number of facebook groups dedicated to this subject  in those groups i have found that there are a concerning number of people that have such anguish over a past decision or choice that they want desperately to believe that time travel is possible  they beg  plead  and even offer money for people to reveal the secrets that will allow them to travel to their past to change their past choices  if someone is suicidal  any idea that suicide itself might provide a chance to relive their life is unsafe  suicide is never the answer and only wastes the potential of a valuable life  so while i applaud haig for taking on this important subject  i just wish the method that triggered the journey to the midnight library were different  a magic potion  a freak accident  a visit by an angel  anything but a suicide attempt a well written parable of one women s journey to move beyond her regrets and find meaning in her life through a supernatural library that s filled with books that represent all her possible lives     more be sure to

unfortunately  i can think of a few things nora seed has hit a rough patch  feeling saddened by her life choices  she enters the midnight library   a library housed between life and death  where there are endless shelves filled with an infinite number of books  each one containing a slight variation of nora s current life by simply opening a book  nora is transported to an alternate reality  and she is able to see how she would have turned out had she only made a different decision  would she have been happy as a glaciologist  or a singer in a band  or if she had married  or pursued olympic swimming presented with the opportunity to undo her past mistakes  nora must decide for herself which of her many  many possible lives is the one most worth living i can certainly see why the midnight library has resonated with so many readers  it s a story about regret  which is a theme to which every single one of us can likely relate  i m sure we all regret something that we did or didn t do and have therefore felt  at one time or another  the pain and heft of regret s burden but for all of its relatability  the novel is also quite dark  with the story being centered around suicide and depression   two subject matters that some readers may find to be disturbing and triggering   consider yourself forewarned  to haig s credit  however  he neither delves too deeply  nor too heavily into the topics  he keeps the story fairly close to the surface  only dipping his toe in just enough to give the reader sufficient character insight  in addition  the tone of haig s writing is warm and gentle  and he does an excellent job of inserting light moments of humor into the narrative to counteract its bleakness and haig also adds a touch of bright  magical fantasy to the story by creating the wondrous midnight library   only to then swiftly explain away and bury that magic beneath theories of physics and philosophy boring theories of physics and philosophy  i should say  and this is part of the reason why the midnight library did not enamor me by taking away the magic of the story and replacing it with science fiction  the story is bogged down and often difficult to wrap one s head around  giving it a bit of a textbook feel  i had to fight hard to keep my interest and focus intact and not only is the novel too laden with science fiction for my tastes  but after a while  it also begins to feel less like a story and more like one big  inspirational pep talk  a heavy handed  in your face pep talk  haig slings life lesson after life lesson at the reader  self improvement message after self improvement message  with zero subtlety  he gives us no space to draw our own conclusions and interpretations  he does not trust us to correctly connect all the dots for me  haig s lack of faith in the reader is what finally does the novel in  by s p e l l i n g everything out  he noticeably weakens the impact of the midnight library  what could have been an exceptionally powerful and emotional read  instead falls flat  clearly  my opinion lies in the minority  and by no means is it my intention to discourage anyone from reading this well received novel  many of you will respond to it far differently than i did  so  here is my wish for those who read it   may you love it  may you treasure it  may you find within the pages of the midnight library all

top bloke  up till now i hadn t read any of his books but i d heard about this one some months ago and the premise sounded intriguing i felt like this book read like one of those eastern philosophical tales where characters exist to make some kind of profound point  it felt like lots of key messages from a self help book were couched within the story which considering self help books are basically kryptonite to me didn t really endear me to it one of the consequences of this approach was that the characters didn t really have much depth  they just existed to make some kind of point and then buggered off  it was also completely obvious what the ultimate outcome of nora s story was going to be  it was just a bit fat meh for me  rather than feeling uplifted  i just felt irritated and a

i think with an epilogue it would be more    complete     more nora seed s life  at least by her own account  is bleak  dismal  she feels it s not worth living anymore  she goes to bed after drinking wine and swallowing pills one night  and finds herself in the midnight library  a place in between life and death  here  nora gets to answer the famous  what if   and experiences numerous other paths for her life   are they better  is she happier  more fulfilled  i liked the midnight library   i wasn t quite as enamored with it or blown away as i thought i migh nora seed s life  at least by her

library   i wasn t quite as enamored with it or blown away as i thought i might be  based on the surrounding hype   but it was definitely a good story and worth reading  i think it would make a good movie too  i felt for nora at times   we ve all been letdown by others or ourselves and likely wondered how one decision shifts life  changing everything  the midnight library is a thought provoking story with the reminder  the time is now     more the therapy session i desperately needed right now  matt haig    sir     thank you  bitch i am healed        stars   the only way to learn is to live

who knows what actually is  so  i picked up the can and i opened  thinking that was filled with cookies    instead of it  there were needles and wool buns  latinxs know about this kind of disappointment this was this book for me  a big ass disappointment the synopsis of this book was promising  full of excitement and hyped  the hype of the midnight library was incredibly huge  i liked the synopsis and said   yes  this may be worthwhile   but i m naive  friends  i never learn from my past mistakes so  nora seed is a depressed woman who thinks her life is meaningless  she was fired from her job  her cat died  she has many regrets in her life  family  friends  love  job  ec   that she can t stand it anymore  the final straw is when her cat dies  she realizes that there is no point in living anymore  so  she kills herself drinking a lot of pills when nora wakes up  she s in a library  but she seems to be alone  until she finds mrs  elm  the librarian of nora s school who was kind with her  this woman offers to nora the possibility to know the lives nora could ve lived if she had made different decisions  and so  nora starts her journey  long story short  nora realizes that she doesn t wanna die  that some of her lives are not the way she wanted  that are disappointing  boring or don t make her happy honestly  if i had the chance to try other lives that i could ve lived if i hadn t regretted many things  i would totally say yes  because  let s face it  it would be amazing to know the things we could have done different  so  perhaps in another life  i would have studied medicine  or modern languages  english and french   or history  or made excercise  or talked more with the girl that i liked  or if i had saved more money  or if i had obtained better grades  or if in another life  i would be your girl   just kidding but  that s not gonna happen  i have this life because i made some decisions  and i regret all of them  but still  here am i   because we all made decisions that brought us all to where we are  we could be happy in another life  who knows  we could be miserable  just like nora when she lived the life where she married dan  i gotta say that i wasn t surprised for the  plots  in this book  i saw coming many many many things in here  the writing was pretty  i m not gonna lie because it was kind of deep  there were many philosophical quotes and thoughts and references that were pretty deep and confusing at the same some characters were flat  boring and simply  they contributed nothing to the plot or to the mc  nora has some deeper and worryign depression  i suffer of depression  but i ve never made it to that point  so i can t say much about it  i didn t relate with her or get attached with her either or the side characters at all  i just didn t care for her  or get related or even attached  please  don t stone me for this  i m being totally honest dylan was ok and sweet but i hated the comparison to a dog that nora made of him  ash was someone gentle  nerd and also sweet  but honestly we never get to know them very well  they re part of some of nora s lives  but they re not relevant at all  just like her parents  her brother  her ex fiance   her best friend  yada  yada  yada    she made some decisions   or didn t for them  and lived some lives without those decisions  trust me  i got confused too at some point  that she didn t enjoy at all  nora also met another traveler just like her  hugo  but he called them  slidders   i don t remember very well at some point  nora finds out that none of those lives are really satisfying  and therefore  she was back in the midnight library  in which  time is frozen at           because she was and wasn t dead  nora discovers that many of the decisions that she made or didn t made were ok    and when she thought she found the perfect life it turns out that she finds she s living a lie  she s faking and pretending to be a mother  a wife and a good person  having a good and perfect life long story short  the library is falling apart and nora must to write in the only book in blank  so  she gets back to life  but in her root life  she was dying  so she asked for help  she learned the lesson and decides to live her life this is a self help book  not that is wrong tho  no  i m not meaning that    it s just that i was waiting  more   i was expecting more from an overhyped book  which i ve seen many     stars rant  note  if you liked it  good for you  because i tried so hard  and sometimes i wonder if i m not a heartless and cold bitch lmao anyhow  this book isn t bad  perhaps my most depressed    year old self would ve enjoyed this with more passion and even shed tears like a bitch  because  trust me  this is the kind of book that    yo me would ve needed and really yearned  i had and have many dark times  folks  that s why i picked up this book in first place  but  my dark moments are anecdotes for another day it was bittersweet to me  the ending was rushed and cheesy  i can t even find the word to describe how it made me feel i do like the message that this book is telling  i really really do  i just learned something  please don t consider suicide as the solution to all of your problems  believe me  i ve been there  a lot of times  but that s not the answer to anything  this is an advice from someone who has suffered from depression since     you are not alone  you are important  you matter  please  talk to someone and get help  you may thing it doesn t help  that it can t make a difference  but it does  we all have our regrets  but we also have our succeses  those little victories that you achieve every day  even if you don t notice it anyhow  this is my review and if you liked loved this book  i m so so so glad for you  because i wish that would be me i m sad that this books goes straight to my  big hype big lie  shelf                                             buddy read lia  katie  mel  juls  lucia  sofia

librarian  mrs  elm  is playing a game of chess with nora  and while nora is intently staring at the chess board  mrs  elm shares a bit of wisdom with young nora  saying     you could be anything you want to be  nora  think of all that possibility  it s exciting  nineteen years later  nora is sitting on her sofa  when a man she recognizes  but doesn t really know well  rings her doorbell  reluctantly  in order to deliver bad news to her  she makes a decision that will  ultimately  she can no longer go on  and tries to commit suicide  but ends up in a library which offers her a choice   to return to live  to choose from a seemingly endless selection of books   lives  to which she may enter a new variation of her own life  serving as the librarian of this library of life choices is her old school librarian  mrs  elm  who gently guides her in understanding how this all works  asking questions  mrs  elm helps nora find the various paths that she might have chosen in another life  one by one  she experiences the various other paths she might have chosen  tackling decisions that she has often regretted  or wondered if her life might have turned out to offer a more fulfilling  happier life   a wonderful diversion for me from these crazy  stress filled days many thanks  once again  to the public library system  and the many librarians that manage  organize and keep it

longer i sit with my thoughts  the more clear it becomes to me that i didn t like this book  i realize that i m in the vast minority with that opinion  and i m truly happy for all the people who loved and found support in this book  but i also feel like i there are some things that need to be said contrary to all the praise  first things first  we start our story with nora  a young woman on the day she decides to die  having been recently fired and having lost her cat  best friend and contact with her brother  she feels so hopeless about life that she attempts suicide  to her surprise  she finds herself waking up in a library  the library between worlds  here  every book contains an alternative version of her life  had she made different decisions  giving her a glimpse into what might have been  but also offering her a second chance of that life  there s only one condition  she can only stay in that life  if she s completely happy with it the good  i like matt haigs narrative voice  i like how accessible he made these very difficult topic in this novel  and the way he streamlined this novel  this is the kind of story that only needs a single plotline  and i m happy that haig focussed on that  instead of adding in unnecessary subplots that would have taken away from the primary one  honestly  the rest of the novel just wasn t  good to me  it was just  okay  safe  bland  and one that has been done time and time again in different forms of media in just this exact way  the bad  i m trying to keep this short  so we can get to the real heart of the problem sooner   \\tunoriginal predictable bland i ve read watched heard this story a million times before  and i based on the synopsis i could have written it out beat for beat for you  and i would have been      correct  matt haig does nothing original or impactful with this trope   \\t nothing matters the majority of this book focusses on nora living through her alternative lives  unfortunately  as we known how many pages we have left  and probably how this book will end   we know none of them will stick  therefore none of what she does during these sections matters  nora as a character also completely lacks any agency  she wants to be  happy   but has no concrete image of what that would be or how to achieve it  making it hard to identify with her as our  heroine    \\tsentimentalseriously  this book is basically actively wrenching the tears from your eyes  it tries so hard to be profound and emotional that it fell completely flat for me  the emotional beats were very  engineered   i could practically hear the sad piano music swell as the important paragraphs arose  it s so cheap and reminds me of the problem i have with  sick lit   using the suffering of a character with an illness to get cheap emotion out of an audience of able bodied people  the ugly  when covering this type of subject matter  you know your book is going to be influential to readers who identify with it  for that reason  you have to get this right  which is why i m extra critical of these stories  the margin of error is tiny  and well meant advise can in fact be harmful to the wrong person at the wrong time   spoiler alert  i guess  although if you haven t figured out the direction this book would take by now  you clearly haven t seen as many movies books with these themes as i have  in the end  nora discovers that her original life  the one she wanted to escape so badly   was her best life after all  despite the challenges she faces  the learns to see all the good in her original life and decides to return to it  the message of  just don t be sad and look at all the good you have  is not one that is helpful with people suffering from true depression or suicidal ideations  it s also a very  for lack of a better term   privileged  stance to take  yes  nora s life has a lot of good  she has friends  parents  a brother  a roof over her head  money  good health  opportunities  so many people who are in a low enough place to contemplate suicide do not have many or even any of these things  not to mention  for someone suffering from depression  none of this will matter to their well being  depression is an illness  not a choice   just focus on the good  is a cheap and easy cop out  and an insult to a large portion of the people this book pretends address     more     stars  rounded upi

life  she doesn t have the  background  she would have if she d been living that life the entire time  while it hits some deep topics  the book is fairly obvious and simplistic  the points haig is making don t take a philosophy degree to figure out  no life is perfect  there will always be regrets  but credit where credit is due  i still wanted to see how all of nora s lives would play out  it

theoretically choatic ones were those which were straightforward  calm even  and the peaceful ones were the most tumultuous  i think everyone should pick this book up at some point in their lives

audiobook  ms  mulligan  please narrate all the books i will think back on the midnight library often and will likely gift it to friends suffering from unfortunate bouts of self loathing or despair  it s a hug and earnest pep talk that would beat a cookie bouquet or scented candle any day  thank you  matt haig  for finding these words and putting them to paper     more damn it  i thought i would

 and explore a multiverse s worth of different versions of herself  if she finds a life she wants to remain in badly enough  she will  and she ll forget her past and the library and eventually it will be as if she had always been there  will you be shocked by the twists and turns of this tale  i doubt it  it s not that kind of book  there s enough world building to generally explain the rules of the library  but don t look too closely or it it probably crumbles  for example  there s no mention of what happens to the versions of herself that she displaces every time she  slides    and for someone so troubled and lost that she had just attempted suicide  nora is amazingly perceptive about the problems in the lives of these other versions of herself instead  the midnight library is a deliberately optimistic story in which nora comes to realize that she does want to live  and that while her root life may be troubled  it is still more right for her and more worth living than some other possible version or no life at all  if you think this sounds a little bit like the movie it s a wonderful life  the author has freely admitted that this book was inspired by that movie  but he previously wrote a memoir about his battles with depression and nearly committing suicide when he was younger  so he certainly has a personal stake in writing a book about  acceptance and realising that often you have a lot more than you think   nora sees how she affected those around her  and was loved by them  despite her pain  she realizes that she needs to stop trying to live out the dreams others had for her  and let go of her regrets   the midnight library is a sort of parable  with a bit of a pop psychology and pop philosophy  and chess metaphors  mixed in  it reminded me of the five people you meet in heaven  but the story works  it s sweet and inspiring  and it lifted my spirits  real people like nora are out there  silently struggling  and you root for her  and them  to find their way out of the dark  to realize they would be missed and have much to live for  i hope the people who would be comforted by this book find it  recommended  it s a bit too revealing to include in the review  but there s a great quote on this idea that i ve placed in the first comment for when i want to go back and remind myself of its wisdom     more nora seed is extremely depressed  life isn

her despair  she decides she wants her life to be over and takes steps to end it  in the limbo between life and death she finds herself in the midnight library this magical library  overseen by a version of mrs  elm  nora s kindly grade school librarian  offers nora the opportunity to choose  books  that are variations on her life that exist in a kind of alternate universe  in theory  think of it like a fitting room in a clothing store  where she s able to try on lives to see if there s one she wants to buy into  the only catch is that the library and any opportunities therein will disappear forever if she doesn t ultimately decide she wants to live i know  the description sounds pretty gloomy and dark  and i can t argue too hard that it isn t at least mildly depressive at times  but i would argue that it has a really beautiful and profoundly good point for all of us don t live a life of regret there were so many quotes that spoke to me in this book  but these are a few that stood out  it is easy to regret  and keep regretting  ad infinitum  until our time runs out      there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness forever  and imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you re in      we spend so much time wishing our lives were different  comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves  when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad   we only know what we perceive  everything we experience is ultimately our perception of it   it s not what you look at that matters  it s what you see   this book is deeply philosophical  so if that s not your thing  you may not enjoy this one  i think matt haig is making his argument to the world to find the possibilities and contentment in the life you have  to appreciate the life you ve been given and to live the life you want  not what others want or dream for you  sometimes a good or bad life is simply determined by what we believe it to be  if you can see the point in the book  it s brimming with hope and possibility         more this review    blog   twitter   instagram       pressure makes us  though  you start off as coal and the

real life lesson    i was just so happy when i saw that this book is dedicated to all the health and case workers in the world  it made me feel special  anyway  i think i am a bigger fan of haig s fiction than his non fiction  i tried reasons to stay alive but i thought it was okay  this was better in my opinion  had very important messages and it was more fun to read  i think i am going to be discovering haig s fiction books in the future the book is about a midnight library that contains books and these books show us all of the possibilities that we could have lived  the protagonist nora visits this library due to circumstances she s going through  we get a quick glance about her life in the beginning and then we start getting to know her through all the options she could have lived  i think the idea is not new  earlier this year i read again again which had a similar concept  but the execution was excellent  i think it is the best book with this concept that i have read so far   a trigger warning for animal death at the start of the book  haig s writing is very digestible in this book and i think it is an adult book that can be easily read by younger readers  i have to confess that i liked the very fast pacing and short chapters because it makes it almost impossible to put down and you re just curious to see what options we will see next and how it will end overall  that being said i think the overall message gets clear early in the story and the ending is not hard to guess but that does not make it any less important because that s the best most positive ending in my opinion and we got that      and even if you were a pawn   maybe we all are   then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all  it might look small and ordinary but it isn t  because a pawn is never just a pawn  a pawn is a queen in waiting  all you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward  one square after another  and you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power    summary  the midnight library is a sci fi  contemporary story that has important messages  the book is fast paced  short and it is a perfect quick read if you are looking for that but it discusses some heavy topics so take that in mind too  i liked the protagonist and the fact that she s    and she s still trying to figure out her life  the idea is very interesting and the execution is very well done  i do recommend it if you are a fan of the genre you can get more books from book depository    more the concept was good  sounded promising  almost magical  and yet the book itself wasn t  it lacked depth  the premise was too unembellished  the explorations of  what could have been  felt mundane and predictable   every second of every day we are entering a new universe  and we spend so much time wishing our lives were different  comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves  when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad    hello darkness  my old friend matt haig and i have had a rocky first introduction  and it seems that we are not fated to be fast friends  still  there is some improvement on the horizon  and thus this review will not be as scathin    every second of every day we are entering a new universe  and we spend so much time wishing our lives were different  comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves  when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad    hello darkness  my old friend matt haig and i have had a rocky first introduction  and it seems that we are not fated to be fast friends  still  there is some improvement on the horizon  and thus this review will not be as scathing as the last  but be warned that it s still unpopular opinion time around here  folks the premise of the midnight library is as follows  nora seed is a thoroughly depressed    year old who decides that one day  after misfortune upon misfortune  enough is enough  she s offered the opportunity to take a gander at all the possible lives she could ve led if she d made different choices at different points in her life    and she can live that life for a while through picking out a book in the midnight library so nora explores  and asks herself the big questions  what if she d never quit her band  what if she d kept swimming professionally  what if she d said yes to the guy who asked her out for coffee  what if   you get the idea  what follows is nora s journey as she explores all these infinite possibilities  in which her other   parallel   alternate selves keep surprising her by whom they ve become  and as she does  she tries to find that one life that makes her happy and is worth living i liked the concept  the execution less so first off  it s very easy to predict this novel from beginning to end  i know  i know  sometimes it s more about the journey than the destination  but i d expected haig to take a slightly more interesting approach than simply having nora live a life for a couple of pages  learn her lesson  and move onto the next one the lessons are given to the reader and nora in very on the nose  philosophy     dialectics kind of way  seriously  at times i felt i was back in my undergrad communications class with a bunch of very awkward students practicing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques on each other often  the way haig gets these life lessons to the reader is also very clumsily constructed in a way that almost detracts from the narrative for example  in one of her lives  nora has become a famous figure who gives inspirational speeches  she goes on to give a ted talk to a huge audience  and starts musing about her recent experiences with her  life hopping  and how our lives are really just infinite branches on a tree  likewise  in many of her lives  nora writes poetry and posts her thoughts on social media   hello there  reader  let me tell you about the philosophy of life   said the author as he set up yet another poem   speech   monologue   song lyric to speak to the reader directly through his mouthpiece of a bland protagonist look  if i d want to read such overt inspirational bullshit  i d pick up a self help book or browse social media  not read a book about a depressed person trying to deal with the reality of being suicidal  me while reading this book  all of them but mostly a but  let s talk positives here for a second  because they are there  believe me obviously  some of the adventures that nora gets up to in certain lives are fun to read about    such as her arctic life or her ash life  keeping this deliberately vague to circumvent spoilers   she continually surprises herself with who she can possibly become  and that slowly opens up her mind to seeing more possibility and potential in herself and her original life the brief dive into nora losing her grip on reality and her own identity was a particularly nice touch  as well  because who are you truly if you ve seen so many different iterations of yourself  so different from who you thought you were that they might not even be you anymore i thought this was a great topic in general to include since depression often feels like it erases your identity in some ways already    it takes away your joy  your hobbies  everything that can make you feel like you there are also some quotes scattered throughout that were pretty good  see the one at the top of this review   even if haig s chopped  staccato style of writing is not entirely to my tastes the ending  though  was another let down  view spoiler  of course  nora comes to the realization that even though her original life is a big damn mess  at least it s her damn mess  and she finds her will to keep on living through it  and when she comes to and recovers from her suicide attempt  all her problems are gone  she revisits old friends and family  considers getting a dog  rearranges her life to better fit her needs    her depression has disappeared completely  there s zero follow up on her still taking her meds or even going into therapy it s such a jarring  sugary sweet wrap up of a genuinely harrowing experience  i get that haig probably wanted to end on a positive note to show that there s always light at the end of the tunnel but usually depression does not go poof  unfortunately   hide spoiler  i want to end this review by making it very clear that i am not here to shit on how haig copes with his own depression  he s been very open about being  and having been  anxious  depressed  and suicidal  and he uses his platform to advocate for mental health    which i think is great it just appears the way he processes and works through his own mental health issues is very different from mine  and due to that i can safely say i did not connect to this book at all  plus  i still do see some issues with representing depression as something that can be combated purely by  inspirational thoughts   seeing your own potential  changing your perspective on your life  putting yourself to work so you can actually achieve something  etc  these things can be part of the solution  sure but depression is not a series of regrets that disappears once you stop regretting  depression is a very serious illness that often requires meds as well as therapy  and is in many cases chronic as well  and i did not feel that it was treated with that level of seriousness in the book  especially considering the ending still  i can see how this book might resonate with lots of people and inspire them to be easier on themselves and their lives  so if its premise and quotes appeal to you  don t be afraid to pick it up       stars   br     br     br     br     br     br     br     br     br     br     br     br     br     br

took to making plans  determined plans  plans to check out but something will cause nora to look beyond the mist and the fog  there s an image of a tall building with classic pillars at the entrance  the fragrance of well bound books leads her within  and there in this unusual library is the likes of the librarian  mrs  elm  she explains that each volume contains a different life choice for nora  she could experience a marriage that she avoided  a missed career as a glaciologist  the professional olympic swimming opportunity that she checked out of  and so many more regrets  haig takes us through the options and we are intrigued for our own sake the midnight library is well written and creative in its approach  haig  himself  has suffered from depression  it brought to mind a billy joel song called  you re only human  second wind    billy joel wrote the song in regard to his own depression and that of a friend s teenage son  it s upbeat and far from preachy or maudlin  he emphasizes that we re too quick to judge life in that bad moment  there s a second wind that comes along and can move us in a completely different direction if we allow it  more than ever  during these challenging times  we ve got to open our eyes mightily and search for that second wind  it s there for the taking a quick read packed with life lessons  maybe some of those great disappointments in life would have been far  far more bitter than the sweetness we once envisioned and wrapped them in     more the story has a slow start  i wanted to mark it  did not finish   i am glad i kept

librarian hands her the book of regret  it s personalized  all the regrets that nora has ever had are recorded in this book  this reminds me a bit of edgar cayce s akashic records where supposedly all the information about our lives are stored  heaven s super computer  so to speak  haig steps it up a bit  creating a personal library for all the possible lives we could have lived or the lives we are living in parallel universes  in the library  nora is between life and death  like schr dinger s cat in the famous thought experiment  here  she pulls books from the shelves and tries on different lives where decisions she has made have caused her to take other paths  it was easy to think of all the different paths my own life could have taken as i read about nora s choices  i have my own regrets and if i could have avoided even being faced with some of my choices  i would have  i m sure other readers will have similar thoughts  how about the life that is most successful  what does that success entail  fame  wealth  status  or those less subtle but ultimately more meaningful markers of relationship and connectivity  haig explores choices and regrets and a meaningful life  the narrative lagged in a few spots  but i was always interested in picking the book up and reading more  it is full of quotable passages  which is something i enjoy about haig s writing  for me  the following is a mind blowing passage  especially for those times when i feel frozen  it made me think that making one more move might blow out some doors or at least open them   look at that chessboard we put back in place   said mrs elm softly   look at how ordered and safe and peaceful it looks now  before a game starts  it s a beautiful thing  but it is boring  it is dead  and yet the moment you make a move on that board  things change  things begin to get more chaotic  and that chaos builds with every single move you make   it s an easy game to play   she told nora   but a hard one to master  every move you make opens a whole new world of possibilities   in chess  as in life  possibility is the basis of everything  every hope  every dream  every regret  every moment of living   never

written it sincerely  so long as there are still books on the shelves  you are never trapped every book is a potential escape   about the book this book was a treasure for me it took me through so many feelings and thoughts and emotions and then finally  it gave me a breath of fresh air this book is about dealing with depression  about suicide  about hope and opportunity  about regrets and making them right  about chances and new choices but most of all  this book is about seeing  it s about seeing that whatever happens  happens for a reason while also knowing it s never too late to make decisions for yourself  it s about stop regretting and start accepting and looking towards the light instead of looking at that endless black hole of thoughts that will do nothing except for draining your life  this book is way more than just a fantasy book  it s not what you look at that matters  it s what you see   review it starts with nora seed  who feels like she s not capable of doing anything right in her life  she thinks her existence means nothing and that all she has ever done is disappoint everyone  that all her choices have been a mistake and she regrets so many things that she doesn t even realize when those regrets start sucking the life out of her  she thinks she has failed at the most basic of things  living but right when nora stands on that thin line between life and death  she discovers the midnight library in the midnight library  there is a book on every single possibility in life for the person who decides to read it  there is a book on every single choice that you might have made differently  like  what if you missed your flight that day  or what if you said yes to marrying someone  what if you didn t like music  what if you didn t like swimming you name that what if and there would be a book about it and we all know reading a book is like a journey so nora travels through these books and lives through them but she can only read at midnight and she can not read any book twice  and why would you want to when there are so many books  of course you d want to read more books instead of rereading them right away  huh well  after reading all these books nora understands what she finally wants in life and which life she wants to live and it s just a full of possibility this book was very relaxing and calming for me  it was overflowing with hope and realization and positive vibes  i must say i recommend it to everyone  spoilers ahead  the best part about this book i loved how much i could relate with nora i loved how inspiring and motivational this book was i loved the perspective this book gave me and how much it helped me mentally people often asked for fun   would you rather go back in time or in future  and i always thought future  but  the midnight library made me realize how right i was to always choose it  even if that was an unconscious answer for fun i loved knowing how amazing it is to go back in time and live life with different choices and learning how harmful regrets can be  regrets don t leave  they weren t mosquito bites  they itch for ever  i loved realising that no matter what we think of our mistakes and no matter how much we dwell on the what if s and if only s  it s what we do now that matters i loved seeing that nora seed understood she wanted to live and make her life better and that she understood that living in the past was like living the life of a ghost and that it was the present moment that she needed to live through and make right and worth it i m very happy about the ending and glad that she came back  i really loved the part where she was happy in her life with ash and her daughter but i didn t want her to stay there  i didn t want her to abandon her real life for it  i wanted her to make her real life that happy and even though it s not something we got to read about in the book  i hope with all my heart that she found a way to be with ash and have a family with him and be happy and feel blessed  i d like to think that she made her life better and was grateful for it  life really is precious and it s amazing how this author wrote on mental health and suicide with such a beautiful fantasy as a help the thing is  for me  that library is real   listen  i am part of the library  but this whole library is part of you  do you understand  you don t exist because of the library  this library exists because of you  remember what hugo said  he told you that this is the simplest way your brain translates the strange and multifarious reality of the universe  so  this is just your brain translating something  something significant and dangerous   that library is inside every one of us readers and as beautiful as the idea of it is  we should be grateful that none of us has to go visit it we should be grateful that someone out there in the world took some time out and wrote this book and made us realize how lucky we are to sit at home and read this book without having to go through so many things i feel like the mrs  elm who was the librarian inside nora s midnight library  she was not sucked into nora s lives when she read them  only nora was  because nora wanted to and deeply needed to live it all and see how far she s come i know i m being emotional but i m very grateful this story               ps  this book was nothing like the  the starless sea  but guess what  after reading this book  i appreciate that book a little more  i appreciate every door i opened through that book and i might just need to reread it and i ll probably fall in love and thank you to maryam for recommending this book  and lilah and alyssa for giving me the motivation to read it    you guys are the best                          pre read thoughts i m gonna cry  this was beautiful if you re looking for a lovely fantasy  full of possibility  this is the book for you  and you won t regret it  it is inspiring  motivational  relatable  peaceful  and life lives actually  lives in books in a midnight library                       another short fantasy book including libraries and books with true stories inside sounds like i ll read it i love reading more than one book in fantasy to get to know my characters well but a standalone is all you want sometimes     more what if you could take a different path and and live a different life  or a hundred different lives  if given the opportunity  such is the story of  the midnight library  by matt haig  nora seed is a woman who has known struggle  nothing has turned out the way that she imagined it would  depressed and

all she has to do is grab a book  each time nora chooses a new life  she has no memory of her new self up until that point  she becomes a bar owner and wife  a rockstar  an olympic medalist  a glaciologist  a wife and mother  once she realizes that that life is not for her  she is immediately pulled from it and brought back to the library to make a new choice  in the end  nora of course  realizes where she belongs and what is best for her  for me  what was prevalent here is the idea of that life is what you make of it and given the state of the nation  i felt truly comforted by that   the midnight library  is character driven literary fiction  fantasy and science fiction all rolled into one  it is wholly satisfying and absolutely stupendous  a heartwarming read that is just what this reader was looking for published on goodreads on              more touching  brilliant  raw  everyone needs to read this  you won t regret it  it really encourages you to look at your own life

innumerable times including every joy and pain  would you leap in joy or curse him to the end of eternity  frank capra s beloved christmas movie starring jimmy stewart has us thinking about what life would be like without you and the things you accomplished or the differences you made without even realizing it  matt haig approaches the meaning of life more like doctor who trapped in a tardis with no controls where you never know where you might end up  for nora seed  the library between life and death is such a vehicle that allows her to travel into parallel universes where life turned out differently because she made different choices along the way  kind of like time travel  but not cause she stays in the same time zone just in different lives  there s a life where she becomes a rockstar  one where she is a scientist  one an olympic athlete  etc  etc  just pick a different book and see where you end up only    haig s library of books is like a genie s three wishes  well  you are not limited to three  there s an infinite number of books  but  your wishes just may not turn out how you think  every path traveled leads somewhere  but maybe the grass isn t always greener and maybe things didn t turn out how you think they would  this is not a fantasy book for those seeking knights in armor  fell dragons  or magic sorcerers  there simply may not be enough action or enough excitement for some readers  it s a fable that uses the construct of an endless library to explore ideas  it s cleverly done and quite an easy read  and there s a sense of humor at work here cause each time nora drops into an alternate life  she s got to try and figure out her new past and how her new life works without anyone being the wiser  not even a best friend or a new husband  it s quite a feat pretending to be one s self when one is not altogether familiar with one s new life  many thanks to the publisher for providing a copy for review     more i really don t know how to put into

saved this book from one disillusioned star was haig s prose  which could be occasionally beautiful  and a couple of heart warming scenes  especially with joe  ash  and molly  otherwise it was insipid  frustrating  and even infuriating at times  even if the notion of undoing regrets were original  which it wasn t   nora s final insights were glaringly obvious and not at all enlightening  i hope my next matt haig novel proves to be more entertaining and thought provoking  this one wasn t     more this book s message could have been inscribed on an inspirational poster or a very large coffee mug      liked it but didn t love it starsmaybe this one just had too much hype and i went in expecting too much  or maybe it s because the world is so turned around  but i just couldn t embrace this one

mental health  letting go of regrets  and making the most of your life     more this is a great read  i loved the premise  a woman caught between life and death is given the chance to go back and change her biggest regrets  it s written with such empathy and is really beautiful at times but i would have liked a little more depth  esp in some of her alternative lives  they were really rushed  and her parents  their deaths are kinda brushed over  surely that would be something big you d want to go back and see them alive   but overall a fab book and definitely one of my favou this is a great read  i loved the premise  a woman caught between life and death is given the chance to go back and change her biggest regrets  it s written with such empathy and is really beautiful at times but i would have liked a little more depth  esp in some of her alternative lives  they were really rushed  and her parents  their deaths are kinda brushed over  surely that would be something big you d want to go back and see them alive   but overall a fab book and definitely one of my favourite reads of            more       just the novel i needed  this could have been simplistic and silly but it worked for me  burdened by regrets  nora gets to experience various other choices in her life  ultimately uplifting  oh wow  wowowow i have issues with this i m actually quite upset at the way this book handled the subject matter like  really this is the equivalent of a tumbler poem as a cure for depression and suicide  based on my past experiences i found this mildly insulting  probably lengthy review to come in my june wrap up  can t believe this was my      prediction  nora has a rough    hours  and she thinks her life is not worth living  she finds herself in a library where she can pick a book where her life would be different than her current life  will nora ultimately find the answers she is looking for  what about happiness sorry  this book has received absolute rave reviews  but this book was not for me  i found it extremely boring and unoriginal  there was a movie ages ago called  the family man  with nicolas cage which has an incredibly similar plot  t nora has a rough    hours  and she thinks her life is not worth living  she finds herself in a library where she can pick a book where her life would be different than her current life  will nora ultimately find the answers she is looking for  what about happiness sorry  this book has received absolute rave reviews  but this book was not for me  i found it extremely boring and unoriginal  there was a movie ages ago called  the family man  with nicolas cage which has an incredibly similar plot  the mc wakes up and finds himself married to his long lost love and is the father to two or three children  nora spends a good deal of the book complaining about her life  i am surprised that she didn t try to bump herself off earlier if just a bad    hours is all that it takes to tip a person over the edge  many people have horrible  no good  very bad days  they don t jump to the conclusion that life isn t worth living  why was the family man better  because it focused on one alternate life  he had built up relationships  in the midnight library  nora tries on so many different lives that deep  meaningful relationships were not developed  there were some quotes in this book that i enjoyed  also  i am absolutely obsessed with walden by thoreau  and he had quite a few mentions overall  not worth the hype  largely forgettable  and a better investment of your time and money would be to watch the family man     more i am not rating this book as i don t feel i am the right reader for this style of fantasy  i found the book totally boring  i do enjoy other types of fantasy  but not this one    this is a difficult one to rate  such a wonderful premise  revolving around the sentiment of one of my favourite plath quotes  alas  such poor execution the evocation of mental health  particularly depression or  beautifully put  feeling superfluous in the universe  are sensitive and compelling  however  haig s prose is choppy  i can t think of another word that encapsulates it so aptly  the narrative is rather staccato  snipped into unnecessarily small chapters with cheap cliffhangers  it s all this is a difficult one to rate  such a wonderful premise  revolving around the sentiment of

compelling  however  haig s prose is choppy  i can t think of another word that encapsulates it so aptly  the narrative is rather staccato  snipped into unnecessarily small chapters with cheap cliffhangers  it s all saturated with filter words that add distance to an already plodding plot i gave up at roughly      the subjunctive  what if  is a premise that has been taken on and done very well by some more capable writers   this interpretation wasn t at all compelling beyond its bare bones with thanks to the publisher for the proof copy     more i read this knowing literally nothing about it other than i ve read two other books by him and he recently won the      gr fiction award  plus  the title  the title was nice and i trust the writer  so i was like  why not i kinda expected some fantasy treatment with a nice librarian  what i got was a fantasy treatment with a nice librarian  the adventure it s all about regrets  baby  so strap yourself in  get your failed life

those other lives on for size  do it again  make all those other choices  get your schrodinger s cat on that s it  really  best of all possible worlds of course  a novel like this is all about the journey  and as for the journey  i enjoyed every second of it  it s always fun seeing what could have been  what if  what if  what if  and we get a lot of those so why is this actually called regular fiction  rather than fantasy  no clue  it looks like an utter fantasy to me  but these lines are divided very strangely  almost as if someone arbitrarily made some strange choice in the past and catapulted this novel into a strange new alternate universe where it was different i had fun  got a few tears  felt depressed  then good again  it s that kind of novel        more this was available

surprisingly  nora wakes  finding herself in a strange and glorious library  wall to wall with books and her old childhood librarian mrs  elm helming the circulation desk  she quickly discovers that this midnight library is full of very  personalized  books  each book is a variation of a life she might have lived  had she only made different choices  nora is also confronted with the book of regrets  summarizing all of her deepest fears and giving her the impetus she needs to select the first life she wants to explore  mrs  elm warns her that even the mildest disappointment with the new life selected will send her right back to the library  where she only has limited time  armed with this advice  nora begins her journey  rocketing from olympic swimming glory to rock stardom  and from life as a glaciologist to barely scraping by at a low wage job in australia  can she discover what will make her truly happy and bring her lasting fulfillment before the library disappears   for good matt haig has absolutely done it again  the first     or so of this book i read in one sitting  utterly drawn in by nora and the beautiful fantasy in this story  haig deals with mental health struggles in such a delicate yet accessible way  giving credence to the real challenges we all face and the uncertainty and anxiety that stems from all of the  what ifs  in our lives  i knew i would love this book from the minute i first read the synopsis so many months ago  and as much as i thought i would adore it  my expectations were exceeded the entire way  haig also spent so much time unraveling all of the layers in nina s character  by the time the book was over i was truly sad to see her go and not be a part of her world anymore  haig also could have easily jumped to a cliche ending  but instead stayed true to life and the character  and i really appreciated that artistic choice  i absolutely loved that i left this story with so much to think about and reflect on in my own life and a new perspective on how all of the choices i ve made in life have led me here  to this moment  now  an imagined future might seem shiny and spotless  but the beauty is in the life we actually make and the love we have to share  this book is beautiful  hopeful  tender  and authentic from start to finish  a tour de force of emotion that will stick with me for some time  and in my opinion  haig s finest work to date           more  every life contains many millions of decisions  some big  some small  but every time one decision is taken over another  the outcomes differ  nora

everywhere for the past   months and seen nothing but amazing reviews for it so naturally i couldn t wait to get my hands on it  very grateful for my friend dave for gifting it to me  this was definitely one of those books where you feel like you picked it up at exactly the right time  a thought provoking  funny and profound read although the topic of the book was quite heavy  the tone of the book was uplifting and funny therefore made it a very easy read and easier to consume the topics which were being spoken about on a personal note  it definitely served as a reflective tool for myself  i think we all from time to time picture how different our lives could ve been had we have done things differently and taken up different opportunities  this book really solidifies the fact that there is nothing you can do about your past  but you have every chance and opportunity for your future  your life is a continuous blank page and you can change things at any time   you don t have to understand life  you just have to live it     yeah  tell that to my overactive  philosophy loving  god fearing brain  this definitely stopped me in my tracks     more q  nora had no idea what

of all things matt haig  for one thing  it s about a library  for another it s a parallel world library  with books being the portals to parallel worlds  considering that i ve just read another great book with parallel world setting in place  the space between worlds    i m loving every second of it yet another thing to love is this  matt haig  being matt haig  just couldn t write a regular world jumping book and be done with it  it had to be set in just the way to be conductive to be therapeutic to the readers  maybe i ll just eat this book to get the most benefits from it    they need to package it and sell as antidepressant pills we start at a library and wind up with nora seed working for    years at a bookshop  string theory  at    she s still there  with a degree in philosophy and a cat that has just died  then our nora goes on a tour de force through parallel lives  in most she leaves a mess behind  in australia  i think  she loses a job  in the olympic life   she leaves behind a mess of a mangled speech  a row with dan  a  disastrous rendition of chopin s piano concerto no    at the finlandia hall in helsinki   and sliding out while having sex i ve   world building question here  was it midnight in the library or wasn t it  if it was and the time actually was stopped then why the tremors  in the real life during that minute there should ve been no new developments with nora  she gets fired in the most ludicrous way i ve ever heard of q it s just that when times are tough i can t pay you to put off customers with your face looking like a wet weekend   what    c  right  what the hell  and she has the most ridiculous talks with people around q  nora seed      yep   i m kerry anne  remember you from school  the swimmer  super brain  didn t whatshisface  mr blandford  do an assembly on you once  said you were going to end up at the olympics      so  did you   i  um  gave it up  was more into music  \\xa0 \\xa0  at the time  then life happened   so what do you do now   i m  \\xa0 \\xa0  between things   got anyone  then  bloke  kids  nora shook her head      well  don t hang about  tick tock tick tock    c  drat  what an enlightening discussion she s a philosopher to the boot q  go confidently in the direction of your dreams   thoreau had said   live the life you ve imagined  thoreau had been her favourite philosopher to study  but who seriously goes confidently in the direction of their dreams  well  apart from thoreau  he d gone and lived in the woods  with no contact from the outside world  to just sit there and write and chop wood and fish   c  q at university she had done an essay drily titled  the principles of hobbesian memory and imagination   thomas hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing  and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories   c  q she remembered studying aristotle as a first year philosophy student  and being a bit depressed by his idea that excellence was never an accident  that excellent outcomes were the result of  the wise choice of many alternatives   and here she was  in the privileged position of being able to sample these many alternatives  it was a shortcut to wisdom and maybe a shortcut to happiness too  she saw it now not as a burden but a gift to be cherished   c  q  life begins   sartre once wrote   on the other side of despair    c she s also a q  swimmer  musician  philosopher  spouse  traveller  glaciologist  happy  loved   c  all failed  she s also q a rock star  an olympian  a music teacher  a

software developer  a receptionist  a hotel cleaner  a politician  a lawyer  a shoplifter  the head of an ocean protection charity  a shop worker  again   a waitress  a first line supervisor  a glass blower and a thousand other things   c so  she gets to the midnight library which is an infinitely large library of all books of all possible lives of nora  her old librarian  mrs elm  is charoning her around   i do think that mrs elm is just a figment of nora s imagination  a brain trying to explain things in user friendly terms and to introduce something known into the vastness of unknown between lives or even worlds  hugo insisted that mrs elm and philippe are interpretations    q i see a simplified version of the truth  the librarian is just a kind of mental metaphor  the whole thing is   c the midnight library q every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be different if you had made other choices  \\xa0 \\xa0  would you have done anything different  if you had the chance to undo your regrets    c  q  every life contains many millions of decisions  some big  some small  but every time one decision is taken over another  the outcomes differ  an irreversible variation occurs  which in turn leads to further variations  these books are portals to all the lives you could be living    c q  librarians have knowledge  they guide you to the right books  the right worlds  they find the best places  like soul enhanced search engines    c the quantum discussion  where would we be without it   q  erwin schr dinger  \\xa0 \\xa0   he of the cat   yes  the cat guy  he said that in quantum physics every alternative possibility happens simultaneously  all at once  in the same place  quantum superposition  the cat in the box is both alive and dead  you could open the box and see that it was alive or dead  that s how it goes  but in one sense  even after the box is open  the cat is still both alive and dead  every universe exists over every other universe  like a million pictures on tracing paper  all with slight variations within the same frame  the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics suggests there are an infinite number of divergent parallel universes  every moment of your life you enter a new universe  with every decision you make  and traditionally it was thought that there could be no communication or transference between those worlds  even though they happen in the same space  even though they happen literally millimetres away from us    c  q  what if there are more than two roads diverging in the wood  what if there are more roads than trees  what if there is no end to the choices you could make  what would robert frost do then    c  q she learned that undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true  there was almost any life she was living in one universe  after all   c q going for a coffee with ash might have led  for instance  to nora falling in love with the person serving the coffee  that was simply the unpredictable nature of quantum physics   c the empowering things q every second of every day we are entering a new universe  and we spend so much time wishing our lives were different  comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves  when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad   it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness  and that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness  you can t have one without the other   but there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever  and imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you re in   c q  you need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess   she said  as if nora had nothing bigger to think about   and the thing you need to realise is this  the game is never over until it is over  it isn t over if there is a single pawn still on the board  if one side is down to a pawn and a king  and the other side has every player  there is still a game  and even if you were a pawn   maybe we all are   then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all  it might look small and ordinary but it isn t  because a pawn is never just a pawn  a pawn is a queen in waiting  all you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward  one square after another  and you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power    c q fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut  despair was when the door closed and locked behind you but with every life she saw that metaphorical door widen a little further as she grew better at using her imagination   c  q she could have been all those amazing things  and that wasn t depressing  as she had once thought  not at all  it was inspiring  because now she saw the kinds of things she could do when she put herself to work    what sometimes feels like a trap is actually just a trick of the mind    she just needed potential  and she was nothing if not potential   c q we don t have to do everything in order to be everything  because we are already infinite  while we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility   c  q   life sometimes simply gave you a whole new perspective by waiting around long enough for you to see it   c sliders are a hoot  aren t they q  i m sorry   his other self said  as he sipped his wine and the sun set behind him   i ve forgotten who you are   don t worry   she said   so have i    c other fun stuff q ever cleaned pub toilets  nora   i m having a pretty shit time too  if we re doing the misery olympics    c q  it was a lot of pressure   pressure makes us  though  you start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond    c  q every move had been a mistake  every decision a disaster  every day a retreat from who she d imagined she d be   she knew only one thing with absolute certainty  she didn t want to reach tomorrow   c q  you don t go to death  death comes to you  even death was something nora couldn t do properly  it seemed   c  q did you do anything wrong  that was an easy one   yes  absolutely everything    c q   while most people were into rock music you were into actual rocks and stuff    c q you have yourself in quite high esteem there  nora   shouldn t i  i mean  shouldn t everyone  what s wrong with self esteem   c  q i have carefully calculated that the pain of me living as the bloody disaster that is myself is greater than the pain anyone else will feel if i were to die  in fact  i m sure it would be a relief   c  q she wondered how many dans there were in the world  dreaming of things they would hate if they actually got them  and how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness   c  q  interesting  i had no idea there was such a thing as between life snobbery  you are an education    c  q to be a human was to continually dumb the world down into an understandable story that keeps things simple   c  q  i have been so many things  on every continent on earth  and yet i have never found the life for me  i am resigned to being this way for ever  there will never be a life that i truly want to live for ever  i get too curious  i get too much of a yearning to live another way  and you don t need to make that face  it s not sad  i am happily in limbo   i kind of like being a slider  i like imperfection  i like keeping death as an option  i like never having to settle     you do realise there are infinite possibilities here  i mean  the multiverse isn t about just some universes  it s not about a handful of universes  it s not even about a lot of universes  it s not about a million or a billion or a trillion universes  it s about an infinite number of universes  even with you in them  you could be you in any version of the world  however unlikely that world would be  you are only limited by your imagination  you can be very creative with the regrets you want to undo  i once undid a regret about not doing something i d contemplated as a teenager   doing aerospace engineering and becoming an astronaut   and so in one life i became an astronaut  i haven t been to space  but i became someone who had been there  for a little while  the thing you have to remember is that this is an opportunity and it is rare and we can undo any mistake we made  live any life we want  any life  dream big  \\xa0 \\xa0  you can be anything you want to be  because in one life  you are    c  q it seems that you have spent all your life saying things that you aren t really thinking    the regrets she had been living with most of her life were wasted ones   c  q you coughed your guts out and had hypothermia but you crossed the river  against incredible odds  you found something inside you   yes  bacteria  i was ill for weeks  i swallowed so much of that shitty water    c  q  it s an easy game to play   she told nora   but a hard one to master  every move you make opens a whole new world of possibility     in chess  as in life  possibility is the basis of everything  every hope  every dream  every regret  every moment of living    c q he seemed like he would be able to sit in a field near chernobyl and marvel at the beautiful scenery   c  q she realised that you could be as honest as possible in life  but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality  as thoreau wrote   it s not what you look at that matters  it s what you see   c  q there was a net of love to break her fall   c     more    nora went through her social media  no messages  no comments  no new followers  no friend requests  she was antimatter  with added self pity she went on instagram and saw everyone had worked out how to live  except her  she posted a rambling update on facebook  which she didn t even really use anymore two hours before she decided to die  she opened a bottle of wine  so  nora  you re a mess  and you know it   nobody loves me  everybody hates me  i m gonna go eat worms   as little kids i grew u    nora went through her

mole had been through everything she d been through  and it just stayed there  not caring  just being a mole  well  matt haig has some surprises in store for you       and your mole but a warning   watch out for the wine and any other bad choices that could send you loopy  hang on  things are going to get hairy  remember your favourite librarian  mrs  elm  guess what  she s still a librarian  and you  lucky you  are about to see her again   as she spoke  mrs  elm s eyes came alive  twinkling puddles in moonlight  between life and death there is a library   she said   and within that library  the shelves go on forever  every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be different if you had made other choices   turns out  you have had an infinite number of choices  nora  mrs  elm will tell you about the robert frost poem  two roads diverged in a wood  and i   i took the road less travelled by  and that has made all the difference        but then she asks you  what if there were more than two roads  an endless number of roads  what would frost have done  what would you do isn t it nice that mrs  elm is named for a tree  a tree that has  well maybe not an infinite number of branches  but a lot now guess what  mrs  elm is going to show you an infinite number of shelves  climbing out of sight into the heavens  filled with your books  your life choices  go ahead  be brave  pick one and dive in  who knows nora dives in  this is fun  a bit preachy and a bit expected  but entertaining  it reminds me of the old quantum leap show where the hero suddenly landed somewhere in time to sort things out  nora does much the same  seeing her life and the people in it from different perspectives  if her life changes  so does theirs  i ll quote from only one  no  two  because i liked the title of this chapter  why want another universe if this one has dogs   below is a favourite  landing   but it s not a spoiler  but since entering the midnight library nora had slowly got used to the peculiar       she felt her ring finger two rings the man turned over an arm landed across her in the dark and she gently raised it and placed it back on the duvet  although the message isn t new  and many of the situations seem a little obvious  it is an entertaining read that i hope might help pull a few people back from the brink  stop them from living and dying and measuring success by social media and dwelling on bitter regrets  sometimes what seems obvious to me  isn t obvious or believable when you re in the depths of despair

saccharine ending  i was immediately drawn into this story  nora is very unhappy with her life and is having a very bad day  trigger warning   view spoiler  suicide attempt  hide spoiler     she finds herself in  the midnight library  where every book represents different versions of her life where she can undo her many regrets  it s a multiverse thing  which i personally love   as nora literally tries out various versions of her life  she gets closer and closer to the life she really wants to have  i will say nora is definitely not your typical person  she has a lot of variety in her lives   i suspect that my own lives would all just be slightly different shades of the same color compared to nora s rainbow spectrum of lives  i really enjoyed this part of the book though as we got to see how decisions led to radically different outcomes  the last life in particular gave me great joy and i was hoping the story would kind of end there  but instead we get this great big metaphor represented in physical form in the story and an ending that left me unhappy with how trite it felt  but that was literally the last    of the book that i didn t like  the other     i was completely enthralled with  i would still recommend it heartily despite the ending     more  you don t have to understand life  you have to live it       the prison wasn t the place  it was the perspective

definitely curious what would happen if i had made another choice at certain times  i flew through this book  this was a beautiful story about regrets and not living your life based on others expectations  maybe the things that you often regret in life are not actually the things that you should regret  there are so many other possibilities of how your life could have gone differently based on every single choice you make  that who knows if making that one seemingly better decision would have turned out any better  nobody is happy all of the time  no matter what decisions you make in life  there will always be good times and bad times  when things are bad  it is not just your shitty life  it is life  sounds a bit cynical but it is true  no matter what decisions you make in life it will never be good times     percent of the time  so there is no use in wallowing in the past  keep moving past and the good times will come  definitely recommend this book  i think that even the non sci fi lovers out there would enjoy it     more i don t read many books that include a fantasy theme  but when i read the blurb for the midnight library  i knew i had to read it  i mean  a story

that s what she was  a black hole  a dying star  collapsing in on itself      an unfinished jigsaw of a human  incomplete living and incomplete dying   nora went through her social media  no messages  no comments  no new followers  no friend requests  she was antimatter  with added self pity  she went on instagram and saw everyone had worked out how to live  except her  if you ve never been in a place where you ve felt like you ve wanted to throw in the towel  then consider yourself extremely fortunate  or maybe you just don t suffer from depression like i do  regardless  life is hard and sometimes it feels as if you get hit with one thing after the other and you can t do anything right but  on the night when nora decides to end it all she becomes stuck in limbo between life and death  there she s confronted with her high school librarian mrs elm who allows her to pick and choose from a variety of lives in which she could have lived had she made different choices  slowly nora realizes that no life she enters is perfect and maybe she didn t have it so bad after all  but will it be to late  nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things that she wasn t   which

makes the life she was given worth staying around for this thought provoking novel is intense  bringing to the forefront so many things all of us have pondered  our own  what ifs  of life  i particularly was drawn to the wonderful analogy mr haig made of life being like a chess game  nothing changes until we make a move on the board and that move might be made in hundreds of different ways making hundreds of different happenings occur  how ultimately true how all our lives and that of our main protagonist can change with a split second decision or one that took years to form  at a time like now  where we see so much doom and gloom and where suicides are rising at such an alarming rate  this book s importance are magnified  i certainly recommend this one as mr haig is quickly becoming a go to author for me thank you to matt haig for opening me up to a topic i find ever so fascinating  to canongate books and to edelweiss for an advanced copy of this tragic yet life affirming story due out on august          jan and i were ever so happy to learn that matt haig had written a new book  after having read and enjoyed his how to stop time  we were so enthused about his new story  happy to say we were once again ever so pleased to have been fortunate enough to be approved for this one  to read our duo reviews  http   yayareadslotsofbooks wordpress       more

get over this book as quickly as possible  first off  matt haig probably without meaning to just gave a big old middle finger to people who suffer from depression and those of us still here  who have thought about committing suicide  most of this book seems to be saying depressions is just really about regrets humans have and hey what if we made a fantastical space between death and lie and you get a chance to live every life you possibly can so that way you can see how important you are and that suicide is not the way to go   the midnight library  follows    year old nora seed who is having a very bad day life  nora is stuck in a dead end job at a music store and gets sacked  her piano student no longer needs her  a friendly guy she knows from her job finds her cat dead in the road  and when nora finds out her brother joe has been in town and not met up with her  she realizes he still holds a grudge against her for not fulfilling his dream of being rock stars  it s a long part of the story i refuse to relive   the book starts a countdown to when nora will take her life  then nora  wakes up  in a place called  the midnight library  where time has stopped at       and the librarian from her childhood is there to guide nora and show her all of her regrets and the many books lives  she can live  we follow nora as she gets to know more about the library  the many lives she could have lived  and the regrets she has around her parents  her best friend izzy  her ex fianc e  who is a tool  and her brother joe  first  depression is serious  depression is a liar  the main character in this book  nora  suffers from depression  but besides haig talking about her pills and that  we don t get any sense that nora has tried to see a therapist  there s a lot that has happened to her and based on her family history that is revealed  it sounds like nora s mother suffer from depression and addiction issues  and we definitely know her brother does as well  i don t know  maybe as someone who has suffered from depression i was hoping for a book that would explore that  and explore how that feels to the person in the middle of it  if haig had shown any of nora s lives with her getting more of a understanding besides hey apparently with no regrets things are great  and you should hold onto the life you have  because other lives may suck  i would have applauded this book second  the character development of several people is not there because we skip around with nora into the many lives she gets to explore  we start to see along with her that maybe her father was a terrible damn person  that her brother was blaming her for things beyond her control  etc  but i don t know  it just felt surface level deep  the writing at times gets very repetitive and i hope you like reading the words  root life  because it appears a lot  i think the worst sections for me were when nora did that stupid ted talk and made me want to scream and when she went off to be an glaciest  or whatever the word is for people who study glaciers  and pretty much met a dude who stole the idea behind what is happening to her from a tv show that i haven t thought about in years  the poems that pop up throughout also made me hard cringe  but many readers who have followed my reviews know how i feel about bad poetry  the flow is pretty bad  i think the chapter that was the worse is when we are walked through all of nora s lives and i just did not care the setting of the book changes a few times and i will give haig credit  he can set a scene  it was interesting to see nora in so many different places  countries  and going through so many experiences  he can capture the mood  the ending is pretty lackluster i thought  and honestly that was actually okay  i just maybe sighed that there is no follow up or seemingly anything that is going to happen with nora getting the care she needs  apparently her  midnight library  was enough      more arc received in exchange for an

follow a different path  would you take up the chance to follow a different life by changing just one decision  that s the chance nora faces in the midnight library  caught somewhere between life and

one decision  that s the chance nora faces in the midnight library  caught somewhere between life and death  she must face all of her fears and decisions  it s a story of regrets  anxiety  loss and grief  but it might also just be about hope too  matt haig s battle with his own mental health has been well publicised by matt himself  and you can see a lot of his own personal struggles within nora  it s what makes her so real and relatable  at the start of the novel she s struggling tremendously with her mental health  in a dark hole of depression  she s struggling to get to grips with how exhausting her life is  she has no hope left  nothing to fight for  and in that moment she makes a decision  possibly her final decision  which leads her to the library  i ve never fried so much as i did following nora s story  seeing her dreams  her changing ambitions  all while still struggling with anxiety and depression  i felt so seen as an ownvoices reader  nora is a reflection of myself  even down to the same medications  and we both have similar thoughts of anxiety and regret  at times she s so fragile  so exposed to a world that isn t ready for her  and i felt every cautious comment and surge of hope alongside her  she s perhaps the most carefully developed and complicated character i ve ever read  the secondary characters  even down to volts the cat  share this complexity and only add to the deep well of emotions at play here  the story itself is built around nora  and grows organically as she does  her journeys to different lives become more strange and extreme as nora changes  and with each life we learn something new about her  i think my favourite life is her time spent with an equally mysterious traveller in a chilly climate   who opens up nora to a completely different way of experiencing life  that said  every experience nora has feels important and relevant to the plot  no sentence is wasted in showing us nora s worlds and the potential she has  it s a potential we all have  but it can be difficult to find when were cut down by inner thoughts and demons  i don t think i could profess enough about how much i love this book  it s become a new all time favourites and i can t thank matt haig enough for so perfectly capturing my own mental health issues in a character that is instantly relatable and complicated      more    ish stars sweet

could have lived  isn t that a terrific premise i loved the concept  and i wanted so badly to love this book  so many raving reviews  i even gave this book full priority over all the other books that i acquired before i m feeling extremely disappointed  there are some good moments with very interesting smart  but sometimes cheesy  dialogues the writing wasn t really that gripping or exciting  i thought that there was a lack of depth and i did not connect with the main character  the second half of the book was better than the first i wanted nora to be unique and special but when i realized that she was just  another one  i almost quit the book  i can t go in details here  as i would spoil the book for some readers please  don t make my disappointment stop you from reading this work  as

list of one of my favorite narrators  just with this book  she was the absolute perfect nora  and i loved the fact she was so easy to understand even with her accent  now i just need her to narrate more books the midnight library is an enchanting  and sometimes sad  story about a woman who has decided she wants to die only to end up in the midnight library with her old school librarian  mrs  elm  here she gets the opportunity to experience other possibilities in other lives she could have had  to figure out if she actually wants to be dead or if life is worth continuing to be lived  clearly that in itself is heartbreaking  but her journey as she tours pieces of these other lives was thought provoking  unique  and makes us as the reader appreciate the life we have  this book could have been depressing and awful  but instead it is a masterpiece that deserves to be read by everyone i read the midnight library as part of a group buddy read and i think it will make for a wonderful discussion so i could easily see it being a great choice for book clubs  i loved nora and many of the other characters  and even though it is a short book it really packs an emotional punch  it was also a very quick read so you could easily read this in one sitting  the midnight library is definitely going to make my list of top books for the year  and i highly recommend it if you are a fan of

about a library  for another it s a parallel world library  with books being the portals to parallel worlds  considering that i ve just read another great book with parallel world setting in place  the space between worlds    i m loving every second of it yet another thing to love is this  matt haig  being matt haig  just couldn t write a regular world jumping book and be done with it  it had to be set in just the way to be conductive to be therapeutic to the readers  maybe i ll just eat this book to get the most benefits from it    they need to package it and sell as antidepressant pills we start at a library and wind up with nora seed working for    years at a bookshop  string theory  at    she s still there  with a degree in philosophy and a cat that has just died  then our nora goes on a tour de force through parallel lives  in most she leaves a mess behind  in australia  i think  she loses a job  in the olympic life   she leaves behind a mess of a mangled speech  a row with dan  a  disastrous rendition of chopin s piano concerto no    at the finlandia hall in helsinki   and sliding out while having sex i ve   world building question here  was it midnight in the library or wasn t it  if it was and the time actually was stopped then why the tremors  in the real life during that minute there should ve been no new developments with nora  she gets fired in the most ludicrous way i ve ever heard of q it s just that when times are tough i can t pay you to put off customers with your face looking like a wet weekend   what    c  right  what the hell  and she has the most ridiculous talks with people around q  nora seed      yep   i m kerry anne  remember you from school  the swimmer  super brain  didn t whatshisface  mr blandford  do an assembly on you once  said you were going to end up at the olympics      so  did you   i  um  gave it up  was more into music  \\xa0 \\xa0  at the time  then life happened   so what do you do now   i m  \\xa0 \\xa0  between things   got anyone  then  bloke  kids  nora shook her head      well  don t hang about  tick tock tick tock    c  drat  what an enlightening discussion she s a philosopher to the boot q  go confidently in the direction of your dreams   thoreau had said   live the life you ve imagined  thoreau had been her favourite philosopher to study  but who seriously goes confidently in the direction of their dreams  well  apart from thoreau  he d gone and lived in the woods  with no contact from the outside world  to just sit there and write and chop wood and fish   c  q at university she had done an essay drily titled  the principles of hobbesian memory and imagination   thomas hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing  and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories   c  q she remembered studying aristotle as a first year philosophy student  and being a bit depressed by his idea that excellence was never an accident  that excellent outcomes were the result of  the wise choice of many alternatives   and here she was  in the privileged position of being able to sample these many alternatives  it was a shortcut to wisdom and maybe a shortcut to happiness too  she saw it now not as a burden but a gift to be cherished   c  q  life begins   sartre once wrote   on the other side of despair    c she s also a q  swimmer  musician  philosopher  spouse  traveller  glaciologist  happy  loved   c  all failed  she s also q a rock star  an olympian  a music teacher  a primary school teacher  a professor  a ceo  a pa  a chef  a

politician  a lawyer  a shoplifter  the head of an ocean protection charity  a shop worker  again   a waitress  a first line supervisor  a glass blower and a thousand other things   c so  she gets to the midnight library which is an infinitely large library of all books of all possible lives of nora  her old librarian  mrs elm  is charoning her around   i do think that mrs elm is just a figment of nora s imagination  a brain trying to explain things in user friendly terms and to introduce something known into the vastness of unknown between lives or even worlds  hugo insisted that mrs elm and philippe are interpretations    q i see a simplified version of the truth  the librarian is just a kind of mental metaphor  the whole thing is   c the midnight library q every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be different if you had made other choices  \\xa0 \\xa0  would you have done anything different  if you had the chance to undo your regrets    c  q  every life contains many millions of decisions  some big  some small  but every time one decision is taken over another  the outcomes differ  an irreversible variation occurs  which in turn leads to further variations  these books are portals to all the lives you could be living    c q  librarians have knowledge  they guide you to the right books  the right worlds  they find the best places  like soul enhanced search engines    c the quantum discussion  where would we be without it   q  erwin schr dinger  \\xa0 \\xa0   he of the cat   yes  the cat guy  he said that in quantum physics every alternative possibility happens simultaneously  all at once  in the same place  quantum superposition  the cat in the box is both alive and dead  you could open the box and see that it was alive or dead  that s how it goes  but in one sense  even after the box is open  the cat is still both alive and dead  every universe exists over every other universe  like a million pictures on tracing paper  all with slight variations within the same frame  the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics suggests there are an infinite number of divergent parallel universes  every moment of your life you enter a new universe  with every decision you make  and traditionally it was thought that there could be no communication or transference between those worlds  even though they happen in the same space  even though they happen literally millimetres away from us    c  q  what if there are more than two roads diverging in the wood  what if there are more roads than trees  what if there is no end to the choices you could make  what would robert frost do then    c  q she learned that undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true  there was almost any life she was living in one universe  after all   c q going for a coffee with ash might have led  for instance  to nora falling in love with the person serving the coffee  that was simply the unpredictable nature of quantum physics   c the empowering things q every second of every day we are entering a new universe  and we spend so much time wishing our lives were different  comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves  when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad   it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness  and that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness  you can t have one without the other   but there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever  and imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you re in   c q  you need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess   she said  as if nora had nothing bigger to think about   and the thing you need to realise is this  the game is never over until it is over  it isn t over if there is a single pawn still on the board  if one side is down to a pawn and a king  and the other side has every player  there is still a game  and even if you were a pawn   maybe we all are   then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all  it might look small and ordinary but it isn t  because a pawn is never just a pawn  a pawn is a queen in waiting  all you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward  one square after another  and you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power    c q fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut  despair was when the door closed and locked behind you but with every life she saw that metaphorical door widen a little further as she grew better at using her imagination   c  q she could have been all those amazing things  and that wasn t depressing  as she had once thought  not at all  it was inspiring  because now she saw the kinds of things she could do when she put herself to work    what sometimes feels like a trap is actually just a trick of the mind    she just needed potential  and she was nothing if not potential   c q we don t have to do everything in order to be everything  because we are already infinite  while we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility   c  q   life sometimes simply gave you a whole new perspective by waiting around long enough for you to see it   c sliders are a hoot  aren t they q  i m sorry   his other self said  as he sipped his wine and the sun set behind him   i ve forgotten who you are   don t worry   she said   so have i    c other fun stuff q ever cleaned pub toilets  nora   i m having a pretty shit time too  if we re doing the misery olympics    c q  it was a lot of pressure   pressure makes us  though  you start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond    c  q every move had been a mistake  every decision a disaster  every day a retreat from who she d imagined she d be   she knew only one thing with absolute certainty  she didn t want to reach tomorrow   c q  you don t go to death  death comes to you  even death was something nora couldn t do properly  it seemed   c  q did you do anything wrong  that was an easy one   yes  absolutely everything    c q   while most people were into rock music you were into actual rocks and stuff    c q you have yourself in quite high esteem there  nora   shouldn t i  i mean  shouldn t everyone  what s wrong with self esteem   c  q i have carefully calculated that the pain of me living as the bloody disaster that is myself is greater than the pain anyone else will feel if i were to die  in fact  i m sure it would be a relief   c  q she wondered how many dans there were in the world  dreaming of things they would hate if they actually got them  and how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness   c  q  interesting  i had no idea there was such a thing as between life snobbery  you are an education    c  q to be a human was to continually dumb the world down into an understandable story that keeps things simple   c  q  i have been so many things  on every continent on earth  and yet i have never found the life for me  i am resigned to being this way for ever  there will never be a life that i truly want to live for ever  i get too curious  i get too much of a yearning to live another way  and you don t need to make that face  it s not sad  i am happily in limbo   i kind of like being a slider  i like imperfection  i like keeping death as an option  i like never having to settle     you do realise there are infinite possibilities here  i mean  the multiverse isn t about just some universes  it s not about a handful of universes  it s not even about a lot of universes  it s not about a million or a billion or a trillion universes  it s about an infinite number of universes  even with you in them  you could be you in any version of the world  however unlikely that world would be  you are only limited by your imagination  you can be very creative with the regrets you want to undo  i once undid a regret about not doing something i d contemplated as a teenager   doing aerospace engineering and becoming an astronaut   and so in one life i became an astronaut  i haven t been to space  but i became someone who had been there  for a little while  the thing you have to remember is that this is an opportunity and it is rare and we can undo any mistake we made  live any life we want  any life  dream big  \\xa0 \\xa0  you can be anything you want to be  because in one life  you are    c  q it seems that you have spent all your life saying things that you aren t really thinking    the regrets she had been living with most of her life were wasted ones   c  q you coughed your guts out and had hypothermia but you crossed the river  against incredible odds  you found something inside you   yes  bacteria  i was ill for weeks  i swallowed so much of that shitty water    c  q  it s an easy game to play   she told nora   but a hard one to master  every move you make opens a whole new world of possibility     in chess  as in life  possibility is the basis of everything  every hope  every dream  every regret  every moment of living    c q he seemed like he would be able to sit in a field near chernobyl and marvel at the beautiful scenery   c  q she realised that you could be as honest as possible in life  but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality  as thoreau wrote   it s not what you look at that matters  it s what you see   c  q there was a net of love to break her fall   c     more

i accepted the offer and dived in that night  for the most part  it s a contemporary fiction novel in which a character explores the different roads she could ve taken earlier this year  i whittled my

in which a character explores the different roads she could ve taken had she made alternative decisions  while it s deemed part fantasy sci fi  it s really not    this is more about the emotional connections and understandings of a young woman who s considering suicide as a way to end her pain nora seed was once a competitive swimmer but gave it up  she had love in parts of her life  but lost it  she had friends and a good life but walked away  she had a bad relationship with her family but tried to mend it  everything she attempted seemed to fail  and one day  she decides life isn t right for her  when she passes over to an unknown place  nora learns she hasn t quite died yet  it s midnight  and she has an opportunity to look at different lives she could ve had    except there s a twist    it s through books with a familiar librarian  she might only have enough time to see one or it could be thousands  and if she dies in one of those lives in the moment she chooses to witness  her life is definitely over  so much to consider here    and i really enjoyed all her exploration i m not gonna comment in detail on the way suicide is handled in this book  i know it s bugged some readers  and perhaps it s viewed as sharing the wrong messages  i don t think that s at all an easy topic and there will always be tons of opinions  to me  this is purely one person s experience  and i respect the way the story is told  there are reasons why it works  there are reasons why it s too fluffy  but the key for me is the trajectory of nora s emotions as she visits each life  i adored the movie  defending your life  for the same reasons as i very much connected with this book  the ability to discover what happens in your own life when you re not looking closely enough is sheer beauty i think this will work even better as a movie  as the visual effects of the library and its destruction will be amazing  having a few key character relationships will tug at our hearts  i would definitely read more by this author  i recommend this for readers who enjoy time travel  but not purely for the scientific aspects of it  and who aren t triggered by anything related to suicide or thoughts of harming oneself  those items withstanding  it s compelling and rich with thought provoking concepts     more inbetween life and death lies the midnight library  maybe it is a coffee shop

life to be created and assigned a spot inside the library s vast walls  now  all that is left for nora to do  is sample some of them this had such an interesting concept and proved as heart wrenching as it was life affirming  nora was an individual suffering under tough mental strain  struggling with finding her place in the world  and seemingly unable to muster any good thoughts  which resulted in her depressive state leeching out onto the page and making this a book i had to consume in small increments  this is a testament to haig s writing  that i felt i could so closely resemble nora and feel her emotions as my own  but is something to be wary of when going in her exploration of the limitless lives quickly transformed these early emotions into ones far more convoluted  as nora started to find her true self this early sadness did not dissipate  but it became mixed with every other spectrum of emotion a human can feel  it opened up hope  alongside anger  and grief  mingled with moments of happiness  haig showed us  in just a few pages  again and again  what it is to be alive haig s acute observations into the nature of mental health and the internal struggles many of us feel lead this to be a thoughtful and sensitive read  but it also becomes one which increasingly let the sunshine in  leaving me in floods of happy tears at the close of it     more i m uncertain as to

premise  and i can understand why many readers found it inspirational  but it somehow didn t have the same magic on me the story is simply about a woman  nora seed  who struggles with life and who is full of past regrets  she is tired of her fight to live and wishes to end it  but  she is offered a fantastic opportunity to live the lives she would have  had she made her life choices differently  through books in a midnight library  it is a pretty predictable story  we understand what the author is driving at  that is to say that the life you lead is the best possible life you can have and that it is the choices you make in life that define you and not your success  the premise is really good and it is the kind of book that i would have embraced  but for some queer reason  i couldn t fully connect with the story  it was sheer torture to get through some of the chapters  and i considered giving it up a few times  but overall  i m glad that i persevered  for the author pulled some timely strings towards the end to steer the story on to a better and more enjoyable ground  the writing wasn t impressive  there were so many repetitive phrases that  at times  i could form what nora is about to say before reading the written dialogue  i find that kind of writing quite tiresome  the author has thrown thoreau s philosophical quotes lavishly to add weight  but  except for a desire to revisit thoreau s walden  most of them lost their contextual significance on me  all considered  it wasn t an easy reading journey for me  although i ended up enjoying the final chapters  i struggled a lot in the middle  rating the book wasn t easy either  i was greatly undecided till the very last chapter  however  for choosing a good and somewhat difficult premise and working a story on that  and trying his best to convey a timely and powerful message to the world when it is in dire need to hear it  i decided on a rounded three stars  keeping my personal perspectives at bay

truest version of you  embrace that you ness  endorse it  love it  work hard at it  and don t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it  most gossip is envy in disguise  reviewthe midnight library is a unique  inventive and thought provoking story  have you ever asked yourself   what if i had done this or that differently  i wonder      that s exactly what nora gets to see  but first nora has to get over her regrets before she can even imagine a different life  it is unsettling and painful to watch nora s downward spiral but interesting to watch her try to figure out her life  and who she wants to be  the midnight library is a poignant  intriguing and thought provoking book  and to top it off it s set in a library  and who of us does not love not a library  the midnight library serves as a great reminder that no one has a perfect life  there will be disappointments  and bad things are going to happen  but it is also possible there will also be joy and happiness just around the next corner  it is what we do in the face of adversity that defines us  the midnight library was written by matt haig who has suffered from depression and thoughts of suicide

focused on establishing a plot or indulges in fantasy as much as it is led by its narrative which revolves around what it means to live that factor should not deter you from reading this book because i found it to be such an exhilarating experience so  what is it about the midnight library that strikes it to be such a fascinating and impactful book  in many instances in our lives  the infinite number of  could have beens  must ve crossed our minds you pick a choice among many  one out of millions of choices  yet the restlessness that gnaws at you pushes you to believe that there could have been a better choice that led to a better outcome we always believe that the choices and decisions we make will always have better alternatives and it kills us because we are always haunted by it  in this story  we follow nora seed  a woman haunted by past mistakes and ridden with regrets  she believes that her life is destined to be miserable  somehow  she holds on to the last thread connecting her to life but rather than find herself in oblivion  she is transported to a mysterious terrain with a building in the size of the church perched in the middle of it  imagine if you found shelves full of books that tell the story of the lives you could have lived  the chance to experience each life you could ve had  the one where you have picked what you thought was the better choice  or the one where you picked a different occupation  or the one you where you had become a happier person  that is the magic of the midnight library along with the heroine  we discover the vastness of life and its endless possibilities it s a book that prompts us to reflect on our life and gives us a different lens to help us have a better look at the choices we make and how we view them what is inevitable  you have no choice in changing it  and that is a difficult pill to swallow you didn t have to enjoy every aspect of each life to keep having the option of experiencing them  you just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed  equally  enjoying a life didn t mean you stayed in that life  you only stayed in a life forever if you couldn t imagine a better one  and yet  paradoxically  the more lives you ve tried the easier it became to think of something better  as the imagination broadened a bit more with every new life she sampled it s a contemporary that coexists in a fantastical setting and it is tinted with a philosophical undertone that indirectly delivers the life lessons the author sought to gift the reader fortunately  the author managed to keep the story at good pacing with its poetic flow while smoothly weaving the important themes into the story without making the dialogue heavy nor dragging the progression of the story it is a story that touched my sentiments because i ve often been a person that drowned in my misery  this book felt like a soft breeze that gently caressed my soul we only need to be one person

newest novel  i ve never read anything by haig before this book  but i can guarantee that this oversight will be addressed  because the midnight library was wonderful  there s incredible philosophical depth packed into relatively few pages  and for a book that begins with a suicide attempt  it ended up being surprisingly positive and uplifting  not only is it a thoughtful novel  it inspired deep contemplation within the reader  but in a way that is comfortingly gentle for the times in which we re living  fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut  despair was when was the door closed and locked behind you   nora seed doesn t matter  not to any single person on the face of the earth  at least  that s what she thinks  when this belief leads her to the decision to end her own life  she finds herself caught between life and death in the midnight library  this library contains every single life she could have possibly led had she made even the slightest of different decisions  if she can find the perfect life among the stacks before midnight ends  she can keep it  but if she s still undecided when the clock begins to tick once more  the midnight library will burn to ash  taking every perspective life  and nora herself  along with it  the thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory  i loved accompanying nora on each of her journeys  not so much because they were adventures  though some of them were  but because i really enjoyed witnessing her growth  as she tackled her regrets  she slowly and sometimes painfully changed both her worldview and her opinion of herself and her worth  it was such an encouraging transformation  and reminded me more than a little of it s a wonderful life  she s more important than she knows  and every decision she s ever made has rippled out to touch others   and that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness  you can t have one without the other  of course  they come in different degrees and quantities  but there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever  and imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you re in   if given the same opportunity nora has  would you try on different lives in hopes of finally finding one that fits  my knee jerk response would be a unequivocal yes  but upon further reflection  i don t think i would actually take that plunge  while i might not be the rock star or author or professor i dreamed of becoming as a child  those possibilities still live within me  and will until i draw my final breath  what i wouldn t change for the world are the relationships i have  i ve been blessed with an insanely fun marriage to my best friend  a tight knit family  and some wonderful friendships  any different path i might have taken could have radically altered any of those relationships  i honestly believe that it wouldn t be worth the risk  instead  i can take those relationships and the potential i know lives within me and make more of an effort to make one or more of my own dreams come true  the worst that could happen is that i fail and end up back where i started  what would i have lost  absolutely nothing but the fear that kept me from trying in the first place  the loss of which would actually be worth failing in order to attain  sometimes just to say your own truth out loud is enough to find others like you  any work of fiction that can move its readers to reevaluate their own lives and try a little harder has accomplished something incredible  and if the book can do so in a way that is gentle and comforting instead of shaming in any way  that s truly something special  matt haig gives us something that special with the midnight library  i can see this being a book i reread whenever life starts feeling like it isn t worth the trouble  the midnight library is hope and potential and solace all packed into one slim book  read it  press it into the hands of anyone you know that might be struggling  let it comfort and inspire you you can find  this review and more at novel notions      more this

around the middle  things started falling flat  i was curious to read about such a tough topic and how the author was going to go about said topic  i loved the idea of it  the message is great in some ways  essentially  stop thinking   it would have been better if      suicide is definitely a tricky topic to address especially with the potential for triggering readers and i applaud the author on having the courage to write about such topics  here s what bugged me   why is it that no matter what the main character did she was always a professional  the list goes on  not once did it say that she tried something and failed  everything was olympian  glaciologist in national geographic  incredibly successful singer in a band  and later in the book as it talks about her different lives she lived there were a million more professional things she did like acrobatics in cirque du soleil    in my personal life experience  i have tried many things that i m good at and many things i m not so good at  guitar is not my forte   why weren t there any examples where she tried and failed at something or was even just mediocre  mediocrity is okay  in fact i feel it sends a wrong message to people that struggle with the thought of suicide in a sense of  look how much cool stuff you could have done and been and you wouldn t have failed as badly as you have in this life   wtf is that  that s honestly my hugest complaint with this story which is why i rated it a    i wanted to love this book and at times i felt is was engaging and fun and a bit of a heartstrings tugger  i just didn t

philosophical information and then put it into coherent thoughts    i could never     what do i do now    you open the book and turn to the first page   on a personal level  i really enjoyed this book  like the conversations it brought up felt like it was just perfect for my current life state  it made me think so deeply about so many topics especially on making choices and feeling regretthere were many moments of this book that felt repetitive to me and yes  i guess that s the whole point of parallel universe realities but there were times i felt it was hard to keep reading and easy to put it downthe ending of the book was amazing    the perfect ending to nora s story   any other ending would have left me with endless disappointment so im glad matt haig pulled through i m definitely going to pick up the author s other books bc he is clearly incredibly smart and talented and knows how to give me a proper existential crisis  because a pawn is never just a pawn  a pawn is a queen in

would have been if she had been more courageous and made  better  decisions  as soon as she opens a different book of her own life  she is magically transported into her alternative life as it would be right now had she made a different decision in her past   to stick with her band  to study glaciology  to continue with her swimming career  the strange thing  i thought  was that nora was dumped into these other lives without context or knowledge of her past in that particular life  or the people surrounding her  i found this extremely anxiety provoking  but i won t give anything away here  because i don t want to spoil your fun exploring this premise for yourself i wanted to love this book as much as i liked its premise  but strangely didn t find it as compelling as many other readers  don t get me wrong  it was an original and somewhat intriguing read  but didn t grab me emotionally as much as i thought it would  i also found the ending predictable  though i hoped until the last page that the author would prove me wrong   he didn t  maybe my expectations were just too high  and because i can t discuss the finer points without giving away spoilers i will just leave it at that  thousands of readers have loved this thought provoking and magical tale  so it s best you go and judge for yourself  it certainly made me reflect on those crossroads in my life that may have led me

music in the world to understand music  we don t have to have tried every variety of grape from every vineyard to know the pleasure of wine  love and laughter and fear and pain are universal currencies we just have to close our eyes and savour the taste of the drink in front of us and listen to the song as it plays  we are as completely and utterly alive as we are in any other life and have access to the same emotional spectrum we only need to be one person we only need to feel one existence we don t have to do everything in order to be everything  because we arealready infinite

i know     more this was the first adult novel i have read by matt haig  and i have to say  wow  somehow he managed to bring both the pathos and depth of feeling of his memoir and the whimsy of his christmas books together into a beautiful book about life  and death  and regret  this book was absolutely brilliant  i listened to the audio  the narrator  actress carey mulligan  was amazing  would make a great first listen  this is not a special book  in fact  it s the most stereotypical book about suicide and depression i ve ever read  everyone loves this and says this is a masterpiece  let me show you my opinion you meet nora  a twenty something who has problems that strangely emerge all on one day  she doesn t talk to her brother  because he must act like a stupid child   her parents are

national geographic and god knows what else  then the sci fi part begins  she ends up at this library and she has the possibility of trying any life she wants  and so she does exactly that   which feels exactly like watching someone else s holiday photos  boring  a bit embarrassing  repetitive and pointless  huge lack in character development  and the ending  i could not deal with this most

her will to live  she lives hundreds of alternate lives  meets other people sliding between lives  but mostly she just discusses philosophy with everyone you see i m not a very philosophical person i have my times though when i start speaking about deep topics and then everyone just stares at me weird  as though i m some alien  i also have a friend who we call jaadu because once she saw the sun and started looking at the sun and saying   dhoop  i feel that jaadu is very cute  i should probably watch krrish again  it s been a long time coming back to the topic of jaadu this book i do feel philosophical at times  just not while reading this book one issue that i had was that it reaches the same conclusion that has already been grilled into our brains  it just takes the long path to do that  which would have been fine if not for the fact that it was not adventurous  it s ironic how nora s adventuring new lives that fail to be adventurous but guess what  polar bears and pandas are my weaknesses and this book had them  so yay to that         more  she imagined  now  what it would be like to accept herself completely  every mistake she had ever made  every mark on her body  every dream she hadn t reached or pain she had felt  every lust or longing she had suppressed  she imagined accepting it all  the way she accepted nature  the way she accepted a glacier or a puffin or the

because you felt that  you need this book  i sure did  like i said in my last review  i am wintering  if you are wintering too  this is a book to take to that space  if you re not  this could be a book that s a much needed breath between the acts     more       i should have loved this book  it s a story that appears very close to my own  i know a fair bit about existential philosophy  but i also had my personal quarrel with death last november and thought  much like everyone around me  that i was about to kick it  however  once i completed this novel i was left bittersweet  and since all

i was about to kick it  however  once i completed this novel i was left bittersweet  and since all of this review relies on the end  the rest of this review will contain mild spoilers  although it s not a book based on mystery so is it even a spoiler  your choice a wise character who shall remain unnamed once said    the hardest thing in this world is to live in it    at first  it appears that our main character who committed suicide learnt that lesson once  spoiler alert  she makes the choice to to live again  however  once i sat down and truly reflected on this book  i realized one thing  nora understands half of this sentence  she understands that life is a choice and one with heavy consequences  on par with existential belief  but she doesn t seem to understand that life is an everyday struggle  every day choice  as existential philosophers also believed in i think this  i m going to live now  no more laziness  no more fear of failure  no more regrets  is very toxic  this fake productivity mentality influenced by a simplistic interpretation of existential philosophy is at the root of a lot of mental issues people face which is sold by capitalism in order to sell more fake productivity shit we don t need or really want  and i m quite disappointed that this book takes this fake deep approach to existentialism  which can let a reader feel guilty for not immediately getting up and doing the dishes they didn t want to do earlier life is an everyday choice  precisely because it s hard  choices wouldn t be choices if they were easy to make this book didn t add that nuance to its interpretation of existentialism  because one can be authentic by making choices and owning up to the consequences that come with them  however  one can sometimes make the choice to sit still or make bad choices  and maybe to be your most authentic self  one needs to refuse to make choices  ironically it s a choice in itself  i know   and accept the responsibility of the bad ones and hope for the best  basically don t make people feel like sh t for feeling like sh t and staying in bed  the book seems so lost in trying to mimic existentialism that it forgot the nuance of the philosophy  the part that would actually be helpful to readers as it would show that nora  even in the end  when she has chosen life  remains human and will still trip and fall once in a while  and sometimes in those trips and falls she ll make a bad choice once again and fighting for life will be difficult again  and that s reassuring what s important about existentialism isn t making  good  choices  it s learning from your mistakes and never quitting the fight besides  there are no good or bad choices  there are only choices you make  those you don t  and their consequences at its core  existentialism is about fighting  not about making  good choices   and that s not what the end of the book reflects at all  it shows nora  suddenly happy go lucky after her suicide attempt and excited to tackle life  and i wish we would have seen some of her trials and tribulations in the future  and saw how she learnt from her mistakes  and how she s willing to fight now now  that would have been a book that would make people feel better and reflect on their lives a bit to conclude  i m coming for sartre s job      more the midnight library is bestselling author matt haig s latest novel and is

places but it manages to be raw and empathetic towards the human condition too  the old adage  the grass is always greener on the other side  fits this story perfectly where others  circumstances seem more desirable than one s own but in reality are often not  a perceptive  life affirming and ultimately hopeful book i know i will remember for a long time to come  highly recommended  many thanks to

mulligan s narration for the audiobook  for me her voice tone and inflections were perfection  she mispronounced some words though  at first i just thought it was english vs  american pronunciation but some words  including a place name of a place near me  were obviously being said incorrectly  i loved the parallel multiple universes alternative lives possibilities  great fun the power of love  the power of seeing the importance of minor choices  being yourself i guess the story is meant to be uplifting and inspirational  even to those feeling despair  but it will depend on readers and their perspectives how they will react to this book  no matter how it s a great story with great characters        starsi could have chosen even more quotes to  like  but here is a sampling of those i appreciated  never underestimate the big importance of small things    well  that you can choose choices but not outcomes   doing one thing differently is often the same as doing everything differently  actions can t be reversed within a lifetime  however much we try  the only way to learn is to live   regrets don t leave  they weren t mosquito bites  they itch forever   every life contains many millions of decisions  some big  some small  but every time one decision is taken over another  the outcomes differ  an irreversible variation occurs  which in turn leads to further variations    equidistant  such a neutral  mathematical kind of word  and one that became a stuck thought  repeating itself like a manic meditation as she used the last of her strength to stay almost exactly where she was  equidistant  equidistant  equidistant  not aligned to one bank or the other  that was how she had felt most of her life  caught in the middle  struggling  flailing  just trying to survive while not knowing which way to go  which path to commit to without regret   between life and death there is a library   she said   and within that library  the shelves go on for ever  every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be if you had made other choices       would you have done anything different  if you had the chance to undo your regrets    a person was like a city  you couldn t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole  there may be bits you don t like  a few dodgy side streets and suburbs  but the good stuff makes it worthwhile   maybe that s what all lives were  though  maybe even the most seemingly perfectly intense or worthwhile lives ultimately felt the same  acres of disappointment and monotony and hurts and rivalries but with flashes of wonder and beauty  maybe that was the only meaning that mattered   maybe even suicide would have been too active  maybe in some lives you just float around and expect nothing else and don t even try to change  maybe that was most lives   yes   said nora  aloud now   maybe i got stuck  maybe in every life i am stuck  i mean  maybe that s just who i am  a starfish in every life is still a starfish  there isn t a life where a starfish is a professor of aerospace engineering  and maybe there isn t a life where i m not stuck   the life of a human  according to the scottish philosopher david hume  was of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster  but if it was important enough for david hume to write that thought down  then maybe it was important enough to aim to do something good  to help preserve life  in all its forms   every second of every day we are entering a new universe  and we spend so much time wishing our lives were different  comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves  when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad   it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunize you against sadness  and that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness  you can t have one without the other  of course  they come in different degrees and quantities  but there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever  and imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you re in     nora wanted to live in a world where no cruelty existed  but the only worlds she had available to her were worlds with humans in them   we only know what we perceive  everything we experience is ultimately just our perception of it   it s not what you look at that matters  it s what you see   she realized that you could be as honest as possible in life  but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality  as thoreau wrote   it s not what you look at that matters  it s what you see   it was as though she had reached some state of acceptance about life that if there was a bad experience  there wouldn t only be bad experiences  she realized that she hadn t tried to end her life because she was miserable  but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery  that  she supposed  was the basis of depression as well as the difference between fear and despair  fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut  despair was when the door closed and locked behind you      more     stars  loved it  the only thing i really wish for is some more  i loved this deep dive into nora and her journey to

haig s imbues nora s story with plenty of humour  although the story touches on mental health  depression  suicidal ideation  anxiety  panic attacks  addiction  the narrative maintains an underlining note of hope  haig showcases great empathy  never condemning anyone as being responsible for another person s unhappiness although the novel isn t too sentimental it did feel a bit too uplifting  i know  i am a grinch   perhaps i wanted to story to delve in darker territories but nora s story is rather innocuous  still  this was a heart warming book  and the  what if  scenarios could be very entertaining as i was never bored  haig as a penchant for dialogues and discussing mental health related issues with both clarity and sensitivity  i listened to the audiobook which was narrated by carey mulligan  who does an exceptional job  i just really loved her narration  read more reviews on my blog\\xa0     \\xa0view all my reviews on goodreads    more what do you get when you mix

glad i found it now the midnight library is about a character named nora seed  nora is struggling with her identity and she is on her last straw and knee deep in sadness  when her cat dies  she decides she is done and attempts suicide  except  she does not die and instead  there is an entire library of lives waiting for her on the other side  this is a tale of regret and hope and second chances and it was very  very powerful  everytime i think about this book  i feel a certain amount of admiration and love because i can t imagine how hard this was to write for the author  this deals with some very heavy topics  i could barely even grasp the edges of it  personally  i have not had much loss in my life  nor have i felt the way nora did about herself but  i could still relate to this  to a certain extent  i think i might read this again when i m older  when i have seen the true ugliness and roughness of life and i bear the scars of it  until then  i will still read this many times because it makes me feel a lot  it makes me reflect on my regrets and desires and impulsiveness  it makes me sympathise and hope and admire  it makes me want to thank my family and friends for simply being there for me in the end  this may not be an easy read for many but i definitely suggest you read it if you feel lost or full of regret  even if you do not  i still recommend you read this because it s an eye opening  heartbreaking and extremely powerful book  thank you for reading my review and i hope it helped  you have as many lives as you have possibilities  there are lives where you make different choices  and those choices lead to different outcomes  if you had done just one thing differently  you would have a different life story  and they all exist in the midnight library

another   has at least one thing that they regret and that eats away at them  having to face that fact and accept that you can t turn back time  might bring you peace but it s also hard  so in a way  this book had a soothing moment for me nevertheless  the ending was obvious from the start   i had actually expected the author to pull a twist of some kind so i was surprised when that never came   lol the writing style was also very nice with short ish chapters that made even the darkest themes more bearable  important due to the subject matter   nothing groundbreaking but definitely very important and enjoyable     more brilliant if you love stories about parallel universes  philosophy and quantum physics this may be the story for you it has been years since a book has left me so

loved that there were many mentions and quotes from famous philosophers  it strengthened the story and added to its genius  the ending of the book is beautiful and the message special  this is my

looked back on our lives and have one or two regrets  if you don t have many regrets you re likely to have a few  what ifs    the alternate pathways our lives may have taken if we had made different

know matt haig has written a memoir reasons to stay alive in which he documents his struggles with depression and his search for meaning and i m guessing his personal experiences have helped shape the themes and narrative of this book nora seed  our main character  is in her mid   s  has just lost her job and her cat and is feeling pretty down and has plenty of regrets  i won t put in a spoiler explaining why  but nora finds herself in the midnight library where she comes across the book of regrets of her life in which every regret she has had ever had since the day she was born is recorded  nora realises quickly that they range from the minor  i regret not doing any exercise today  to the substantial  i regret not telling my father i loved him before he died   in the midnight library  with the assistance of her favourite school librarian mrs elm  she has access to parallel universes and can immerse herself and actually live in a particular life and see if she likes it or not  she finds herself in a life where  rather than quit swimming at     she does continue with it and was good enough to get to the olympics  she transfers to another life where  rather than call off her wedding at the last moment  she does marry dan and they are running a country pub as was previously discussed and planned  in another experience  rather than use commitments as an excuse to stay home  she does go to australia with her friend lizzy  as well as all of these lives related to her  root life   she gets to taste a wild array of other lives at her whim and fancy i think this book is a lot of fun  i can understand how some readers may feel it treats the serious subject matter in an overly light hearted way but it worked for me and i am adding it to my      favourites nora really is in a state of despair  she has always struggled to accept herself and she can t find any reason to keep living   but i didn t at any stage feel weighed down by nora s state of mind and her feeling of helplessness  instead i found it uplifting and inspiring  for that reason alone i have to give it   stars  matt haig has done a great job of weaving in a healthy dose of philosophy  e g  thoreau s  it s not what you look at that matters  it s what you see    along with servings of humour  time travel  quantum physics and parallel universes to look at what it is to be human and to find meaning in your life       it is easy to regret  and keep regretting  ad infinitum  until our time runs out  but it is not the lives we regret not living that are the real problem  it is the regret itself  it s the regret that makes us shrivel and whither and feel like our own and other people s worst enemy  we just have to close our eyes and savour the taste of the drink in front of us and listen to the song as it plays  we are completely and utterly alive as we are in any other life and have access to the same emotional spectrum     yesterday it was impossible for me to accept my life as it is now

lets the reader live out their own dreams through nora and i love that about it  nora is so real and just  well  human  she could be you or your friend or your neighbour  haig has done a truly fantastic job at bringing his readers to life in the pages of these books  which makes this book read as something very special indeed aside from the leading concept of this book  it also looks at our relationships with others  how we treat those we love  how we treat ourselves  our planet  at one point nora works in climate change and we get an insight into the failings we as humans are offering to our planet  matt haig honestly does try to put a lot of issues into this book of humanity and he succeeds  this book is almost an anthem of literature for change  regret and living our lives how we want to live them  i really liked that this book certainly leaves you wanting to live your life to the full  but also that doesn t have to be scuba diving and cliff diving  it can be enjoying the things you love and finding joy in them this book was such a simple concept that just dug so deep into its themes  i always think matt haig does a brilliant job of normalising talking about mental

notes on a nervous planet  which was a book that really helped me when i was in a really hard place mentally   the midnight library  was so real about mental health  but matt haig also speaks to

times  but there is more to life than fantastic sex    yes  the pitch is great  nora  the protagonist  is in a really dark place emotionally  overwhelmed with regrets about the decisions she s made in her life  and she gets a chance to live a life where she hasn t made the wrong decisions  where she doesn t end up in that dark place   and who can t relate to that  having regrets is a very human thing  regrets are one thing that sets humanity apart  because nothing else on this planet has regrets  well  i think my cat may regret that it wasn t born as a tiger  but i can t be sure of that  so it doesn t count   so that s the pitch  the pitch works  because every single one of us can understand nora  we all regret something  be it that we didn t ask a certain person on a date  that we didn t choose another job  that we didn t bet a lot of money on the patriots when they were down      in the super bowl  life is full of regrets  so we can relate to nora  just like we can relate to addie

that i am  i didn t care  because i knew where this was going to end  and because the road there wasn t intriguing enough to make me enjoy it  yes  there were some heartbreaking moments had to face  but in a way i kept thinking  this isn t real  no matter how often schr dinger s cat was mentioned  i didn t feel this was real  this wasn t like harry and dumbledore at king s cross  this couldn t make me feel for the characters  it does for a lot of people  but not for me   the prose isn t my thing  it s too reduced to reach me  it s    bland  not sure i can say that  but it never enchants me  and there are only two quotes i marked while reading this book   a person was like a city  you couldn t let a few less desirable parts let you off the whole  there may be bits you don t like  a dew dodgy side streets and suburbs  but the good stuff makes it worthwhile   and the thing you need to realise is this  the game is never over until it is over  it isn t over if there is a single pawn still left on the board  if one side is down to a pawn and a king  and the other side has every player  there is still a game  and even if you were a pawn   maybe we all are   then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all  it might look small and ordinary  but it isn t  because a pawn is never just a pawn  a pawn is a queen in waiting  all you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward  one square after another  and you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power    the latter one sounds like a real good pep speech  i ll try to use it for my football team at some point  anyway  the bottom line is  it obviously works for a lot of people but it didn t work for me  it failed to deliver the x factor  it never managed to enchant me   three stars

immature  i felt similar about frederik backman s beartown as well   highly quotable book   yet doesn t give feel  mature enough   though beartown is a much better book   and  the way the philosophy is incorporated into the story feels a bit lame at a few places for instance  see this conversation  mrs elm quickly rummaged for the paper tissue     she brought it quickly to her face and sneezed into it  bless you   said nora  watching as the tissue disappeared from the librarian s hands    don t worry  tissues are like lives  there are always more   mrs elm returned to her train of thought   doing one thing differently is often the same as doing everything differently  now you have to philosophize sneezing into paper tissue as well  really  does is sound sensible lame anyway  i don t

as a scientist in sub zero temperatures in the norwegian archipelago  she is an olympic athlete  a vegan powerlifter  rich  poor  the possibilities are infinite  throughout it all  haig seamlessly interjects magic into the most prosaic of details  furthermore  in his bestselling memoir  reasons to stay alive   haig chronicled the personal anxiety and depression he experienced which lead him to consider taking his own life  in  the midnight library   he is just as unflinching in his depiction of depression  he seamlessly articulates how debilitating it can be  how it can feel like you re stuck in a black hole  and yet  his writing never feels dismal  rather  he counterbalances sombre moments with a hopeful tone and a touch of humour  while sometimes nora s monologues were repetitive  the meaning was clear  even when you feel like you re trapped  there is always a way out of the darkness there s so much more to unpack in this book  from ideas around climate change and the connection between ourselves and the world to familial relationships  fame  and the nature of happiness  matt haig tackles so many themes with such grace  a reminder to live life to the fullest and appreciate every moment  even the hard ones  as nora tries on the many shoes of her infinite lives  we see how making space for regrets is one step towards softening their hold over us  we can have regrets without being their prisoner overall   the midnight library  is a truly inspiring story that  yes  is full of hurt and despair  but also love and transformation  haig eloquently articulates the consuming nature of depression for those who find that words escape them  as with  reasons to stay alive   i m so grateful for this book and vouch that everyone should read it  the only way to

regrets and undoes some of her past decisions  it becomes clearer that maybe there is no such thing as a perfect life  the short chapters made this narrative flow quite nicely  the prose is simple but powerful  the concept is impactful  who has not wished for a different outcome in life at some point  there is a mention of quantum physics in the story but it is not overwhelming and is simply explained  above all  this book is thoughful and well rendered  the tone is solemn  its not a book that can be called fun or entertaining but its certainly memorable  this is the first time i read a book by matt haig and i have just learned that he deals with mental health issues  his observations and thoughts do reflect that  they are honest and hopeful  i am glad to hae read this book and will look into more books by haig in the future     more  it s not what you look at that matters  it s what you see  regrets  choices  chances  decisions  closures  and acceptances  those are the   big

helpless  and lost  she is at the point of giving up life  sad  but many could relate to her for this  just at the brink of death  she found her way into a mystical library filled with many books detailing the possibilities and potentials where one s life could have a different version  nora is faced with decisions to change her life for the better  followed another career  undoing a mess up relationship  and perhaps go after her passion  at the heart of the book  the beautiful concept derived from philosophical multiple universe theory develops from every choice and decision  though it was not discussed in depth  the focus is mainly on nora s disposition to go on living or to end it all  nora s depressive and indecisive character may seem languid but good enough to be contemplative  an introspective book that ended on a crucial note leaving meditative thoughts about life in perspective  the narrative is pleasant  engaging  and comfortable  liken to a magical story where it can foster one s imagination for a good night s dream  eventually  as i followed nora s journey in her life  i realized no perfect life  still  there s one life with lessons from mistakes  closure to regrets  acceptance of failures  and lastly  being patient with life as it unfolds in bad times and good times     more dnf      please don t hate me for this  although i found it plot interesting at first  i was really looking forward to it  but then i kind of disappointed by how the story turned out nora had tried a ton of life she could have lived provided by midnight library  but there wasn t much depth detail in any stories and characters from each of her life  she jumped in  talked to people for a bit  and then jumped out  she genuinely hadn t really lived in those lives  you know what i

put here at least a couple of quotes  who wouldn t love to live  just for a little while  each one of the infinite variations of the life he could have possibly had  if he had done something  even the most trivial thing  differently   maybe there was no perfect life for her  but somewhere  surely  there was a life worth living  thank you for antidepressants  therapists  yoga  nah  i ll have this book instead  there are no spoilers in this review but i was just so fascinated by this book i had to put here at least a couple of quotes  who wouldn t love to live  just for a little while  each one of the infinite variations of the life he could have possibly had  if he had done something  even the most trivial thing  differently   maybe there was no perfect life for her  but somewhere  surely  there was a life worth living  thank you for letting me into that magical place  between life and death  where nothing is impossible and everything is possible as a person who has been struggling with depression ever since i can remember myself  this masterpiece allowed me a temporary refuge in the form of nora  i felt understood  i felt like i was not alone  i felt like everything could and would be okay  because you are more than the sum of your depressive episodes  you are an amazing human being with an infinite number of possibilities like nora  i felt underfulfilled most of my life and destined to live a bland  boring  and ordinary life  why should i even aspire for more and to become more  that s life  life sucks  what can you do about it  you can work hard and achieve a lot of things  but at the end of the day your life expectancy would still be around       years at best  i always felt like i could hope for more  and that is all that was  hope  but then when my life was accidentally on the line  the most primitive instict kicked it  to live  so should one listen to the primitive part of the brain  telling him her them to stay alive  or better listen to that more evolutionarily developed portion of his her their brain  the neocortex  forming the conscious mind and giving the possibility to form coherent train of thoughts  forcing you to analyze every tiny bit of your life and telling you there s basically nothing special about it after all  because the greatest sin of humankind is mistakingly thinking we are somehow more important than we actually are  or just as we wrongly believe ourselves to be  we are maybe important to someone or several someones  but to the univerese we are no more significant than a grain of salt  that was how she had felt most of her life caught in the middle  struggling  flailing  just trying to survive while not knowing which way to go  which path to commit to without regret  i related so much to nora  give and take a few things   and maybe that s what made this book such an  enlightening  experience for me  i m certain all of us  even the most optimistic ones  found himself or herself or themselves in a depressive state at least once or twice in their life  this book does not perpetuate your depression  nor does it feed it  on the contrary  it gives you a pure glance as an outsider into the mind of a struggling depressed person trying to find the will to live  and i know there are literally thousands of books about depression  which i usually can t stand readimg   and idk why but this book in particular was and is very special to me  maybe it s the extra touch of fantasy  which i can never  for the life of me  turn down   she didn t want to die  and she didn t want to live any other life than the one that was hers  the one that could be a messy struggle  but it was her messy struggle  a beautiful messy struggle   you\\xa0will\\xa0never be happy\\xa0if\\xa0you continue to search for what happiness consists of  you\\xa0will\\xa0never\\xa0live if\\xa0you are\\xa0looking for the meaning of life  it s just amazing how i constantly got the feeling this book is the best friend i should have always had and unfortunately never did this book should be made into a movie                                        this book really manages to grasp the concept of severe depression and revive it in the form of nora perfectly  i m literally trying to read as much as i possibly can in between classes  i just can t get enough  i wish i had more time to read  otherwise i would have been done with it in a heartbeat                                          between life and death there is a library  and within that library  the shelves go on forever  every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived  to see how things would be if you had made other choices       would you have done anything different  if you had the chance to undo your regrets  okay i haven t even started reading the book yet and i m already hooked                                         this book sounds a bit similar to the starless sea by erin morgenstern  and i m just in love with the synopsis   my uni website  you have    topics to study by tomorrowmy brain      more it seems i just keep reading bad books but i won t give up let s try this one       pls pls pls pls pls be good  jeez  i m getting tired reading bad books  it seems i just keep reading bad books but i won t give up let s try this one       pls pls pls pls pls be good  jeez  i m getting tired reading bad books     more the only reason that i read this was because it was chosen the winner of the goodreads choice awards in the fiction category  the synopsis sounded stupid to me  boy  talk about calling it earlypuerile doggerel that s part huckster get rich quick bullshit  and part tv evangelist  this is just like those moronic homilies in which people say stuff like  coulda  woulda  shoulda  without being ironic  one of my favorite novels is memoirs of an invisible man by h f saint  which means that i don t have the only reason that i read this was because it was chosen the winner of the goodreads choice awards in the

problem with suspending belief  but this doesn t even make any sense  the top review of this book has over       likes  and is four sentences of stock praise with nothing approaching insights or critiques  there is nothing about the book  a review  by definition  is supposed to be a critical examination  not just gushing over how much you loved it  the antonym of this review would be the following  it sucked  i would never just write  it sucked  because i would outline specifically why i thought it sucked  which i will do here concerning goodreads fiction of the year readers  choice this novel is the moral equivalent of listening to a baby cry for several hours  or however long you read this before throwing in the towel  except babies often have a reason for crying and don t do it purposefully simply to annoy us  waaaa  my life isn t perfect  i m not happy  fucking grow up  her choices in life are olympic swimmer or packed arena rock star  just stupid it annoyed the hell out of me that she didn t know anything about the life she was entering and had to ask stupid questions  like some oaf who enters a movie theater after it s started and asks a stranger next to her to bring her up to speed  way too much of the book is in this irritating vein  i ve noticed some british writers use the words  at all   pronounced  eh toll   too much  don t  it was nothing  and  it was nothing at all  mean exactly the same goddamn thing  once you notice this  it becomes like trying to ignore a tourette s syndrome verbal tick  she wondered for a moment if she shouldn t get the door at allgone in wonderful directions  but now went nowhere at allshe could no longer see the walls at allit was possible that the shelves weren t moving at allit will hardly be there at all they couldn t really be seen as individual books at all she was no longer a person reading it  and a consequent moment where there was no book   or library   at all sometimes regrets aren t based on fact at all the house key had no information on it at all floating in a tank that resembles nothing at all and this time she was aware of feeling absolutely nothing at all no problem at allshe said it casually  almost as if it was nothing at all and then decided he didn t want to go to uni at all and the moment she had said it was nice to be there  was also the moment she wasn t there at allare there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change hardly a laugh at all nothing  nothing at all in most lives i don t know you at allshe felt like she might not have been there at all  p   or soon there won t be a choice at all not a message at all but a photo of a whale the chandeliers  the flowers  all became nothing at all so why live at all but without really knowing him or thinking about him at all not long at all in most she wasn t a hypochondriac at alla memory so vague and intangible it will hardly be there at allstanding there without any fear at allcouldn t see anything at all nowonce i started this search  i couldn t stop  so yeah  anyone care to explain this to me  take out  at all  from any of these phrases and the meaning is exactly the same  if anything  this verbal tick  this redundancy  dilutes the negative sorry  but groundhog day tells a story ten times more interesting than anything you will find between the covers of this young adult novel  the philosophy in this was childish  like the author had just read a wikipedia article on the subject before stuffing it into this book  i would never consider henry david thoreau to be a philosopher i read how to stop time by this writer  i thought the premise was amazing  but the execution was absolutely dreadful and annoying  i didn t really care for the premise of this book  i don t think people look back and put blame on the regrets of their life  he just doesn t tell any good stories  nothing happens in this that i care to remember a day later     more nora seed hasn t had the best week  in

and finds her school librarian  mrs elm there and mrs elm informs nora that she is in an in between place and here she has an infinite number of lives that she could choose from  all she has to do is go through the book of regrets and choose a different life and she ll end up there  if she is disappointed there  she ll come back to the midnight library and she can choose another life   she stepped outside  wondering whether a life could really be judged from just a few minutes after midnight on a tuesday  or maybe that was all you needed  nora tries life after life but she always ends up not liking it or being a stranger in her own life no matter how popular or how successful or how rich she is and always ends up back at the library  mrs elm smiled  wryly   it just shows you  doesn t it   shows me what   well  that you can choose choices but not outcomes  but i stand by what i said  it was a good choice  it just wasn t a desired outcome   then mrs elm tells nora that maybe she should try lives where the regrets weren t obvious  even after trying those lives and even liking one where she thought that it could be her new life  she still ends up at the midnight library and at last she understands that she won t feel at home in any of her other lives because even though technically all of those are her lives  practically she didn t live them   are there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change  she does get fresh perspective through her journey and she also realizes that she wants to live  never underestimate the big importance of small things  she wakes up in her root life and decides to turn everything around as her perspective has changed  that the prison wasn t the place  but the perspective  she decides to teach piano lessons and also catch up with mrs elm even though she doesn t remember nora and it is not the same mrs elm from the midnight library  she also makes up with her brother  may be there was no perfect life for her  but somewhere  surely  there was a life worth living  this was such a great read  i loved the writing and i was engrossed from the very beginning  i didn t like nora in the beginning but she grew on me and i was rooting for her throughout  i felt her journey like it was my own journey  how many times have i thought of making different decisions but i also know that if i were given the chance all over again  i would still make those exact same decisions because they felt right in my heart at the time   view spoiler  i suspected how it would end but more that that i wanted nora to choose her root life right after the sadness she felt in her first alternate life and i am so very happy to know that s exactly how it ends   hide spoiler    stars    more frustratingly predictable    somebody told me   don t waste your time on this  it s not as good as it could have been   guess what  i didn t listen   i picked this one up the other day  and it was so hard to put down what if you said yes instead of no  what if you turned left instead of right  there are so many different ways to go in life  an infinite number of possibilities  and anything could happen  we have no way of knowing  i

decision a person could make   to keep going  or to end it all  and what happens when someone dies  what becomes of that person  someone who doesn t think they matter to anyone else in the world could actually mean the world to someone else  it does sound cliche to put it that way  but it s true  your life has a ripple effect  even if you don t think so  your choices don t have the potential to affect just you but it could affect those in your life  even if they aren t ones you keep in touch with day in and day out this book really made me think about how my choices impacted my life and how they have impacted others close to me  i matter     and so do you   so  don t  ever  give  up     more is it sci fi  is it fantasy  whatever it is  it was a magical read  loved the way matt haig

seed  decides to take her own life and finds herself in a library that houses every possible variation of her life  from there we get bits and bobs of philosophy  quantum physics  and cognitive behavioural therapy as plot  herein lies the rub  the book felt more like self help than adventurous or revelatory  the plot as therapy beats came off a bit too heavy handed and i found i could see the ending a mile away  i m sure for a lot of people in      this book lands at a resonant moment  lots of people are in a tough space  mentally  and nora s misanthropic zipping through the multiverse is relatable  but the lessons she learns are also applicable to everyday life  i don t begrudge this experience of the novel  i just found it personally grating  there are some good passages in here and one of the last lives nora lives in the novel hits an emotional peak that failed to land with the other quantum forays  it s not that this is a terrible work  it s just one that didn t work for me  it s a shame i didn t enjoy this more  but providing haig s other work is less narrative cbt manual  i think i d be into it  ah well     more tw  depression  suicide nora seed s life is in shambles

were so many philosophical quotes that i fell in love with the only thing i didn t like was the ending  i mean it s a hopeful ending but it felt kinda sickly sweet for my taste no doubt that this is a

will be slipped in  and handcuffed to her without even knowing it  when she lands in the library  all of a sudden you will be there  too  wondering if your books are on shelves somewhere  then later  when a variation is provided on that theme there will be a little  pop  as you realize maybe yours isn t a library at all       again  brilliant matt haig just got a new fan read this book  see if i m

properly introduced in the beginning  so as our lead character lives out alternate versions of her life  you re never able to connect in an emotional way to the other people in her life or their

know her  but she does not know them  nor does she know the context up to the point where she joined this particular version of her life  for me  the only drawback is that it sometimes takes nora almost no time to determine a particular version of her life is not to her liking  this happens  as you may expect  numerous times   i enjoy matt haig s writing style and appreciate his desire to help

cool  i ve never had this moment in my life but if i did  and i went to the library  i m sure my opinion on everything would ve changed for the better  mostly because life is worth living  everyone

book blogger  i ve made no secret of how much that book means to me   i read it a few months after my brother took his life and it became my beacon of light at a dark time  it s a bittersweet coincidence then that the midnight library was published on the eighth anniversary of my brother s suicide and that the lead character  nora seed should be suicidal herself i can t pretend that the early chapt the humans by matt haig was the first book i ever reviewed on my blog and is the reason i became a book blogger  i ve made no secret of how much that book means to me   i read it a few months after my brother took his life and it became my beacon of light at a dark time  it s a bittersweet coincidence then that the midnight library was published on the eighth anniversary of my brother s suicide and that the lead character  nora seed should be suicidal herself i can t pretend that the early chapters were easy to read   over the course of a few days nora reaches the point where she decides that she wants to die   but i was reading it during what is always an emotional week for me  as the story progresses  nora is given the opportunity to explore what her life could have been like had she made other choices or decisions as matt haig returns to the life affirming themes i have come to associate with his books  written with deep understanding and warm hearted honesty  the midnight library is a thought provoking  perceptive paean to hope and the power of books nora learns that she can undo her regrets and in her midnight library  guided by her old school librarian  mrs elms  the books on the shelves are filled with her alternative lives  as she hovers between life and death in her original or  root  life  she is able to experience what it would have been like to have followed her dreams or even just agreed to a coffee  if she ever finds a life she likes  she ll be able to stay in it and will eventually forget the midnight library  she might run a country pub with her husband  the man she jilted just before her wedding in her root life   be a glaciologist working alongside other scientists in the arctic or perform to packed out stadiums as a world famous rock star  however  it turns out that no matter how exciting or interesting her life may be  she keeps returning to the library  although there are an infinite number of lives contained in the books  if nora dies the library and everything in it will be destroyed  my favourite film of all time is it s a wonderful life and there are elements of the midnight library that are reminiscent of that story  just as george bailey was forced to put his dreams on hold time and again  so nora is filled with regrets for what she has lost or missed out on  both george and nora feel trapped and stifled in their home towns but george has clarence to show him what he means to the people of bedford falls and it can t be a coincidence that mrs elms is there to guide nora towards finding out that her actions affected more than just her own life in bedford  this is an uplifting novel but like it s a wonderful life  it has a darker side and doesn t forget that life can be difficult and painful  there is no mr potter here but nora s own personal villain is her depression and that she has allowed her regrets to define who she believes she is  as always matt haig writes about mental health issues with compassionate insight and sensitivity  the midnight library may be a fantastical premise but it is never false and through an accessible and engaging mix of quantum physics  philosophy and love  matt haig tells a beautiful  poignant and empathetic story of redemption and hope  the midnight library is the perfect reminder that even when times are tough  it can still be a wonderful life      more  she realised that you could be as honest as possible in life  but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality  as thoreau wrote   it s not

so interesting   she s happy in some  unhappy in others  every time she comes back to mrs elm and decides to pick up a new book this book really warmed my heart and soul  i loved nora and i love the story of a person coming out of the darkest depths to discover something interesting  the premise of this was overly done or too cheesy  it worked perfectly as it should  and i appreciate the nod to the science aspect of the parallel lives concept  any book lover would enjoy this novel and i think i ll find myself slowly thinking about nora seed over and over again     more     starsreally

chair and glided soundlessly out of her cubicle  down the corridor  and through the heavy metal door  funny  she thought  usually it was locked  but it had given way with a touch  she d never opened this door  let alone passed through its threshold  on the other side  she d expected all manner of monsters  fire breathing dragons  devils with red laser eyes  drunk writers with sour whiskey breath  there were no monsters  nor was there a great white light where her rotten relatives now dead and therefore enlightened reached out to grasp her to their bosoms and chests  apologizing for all their corporeal sins against her and welcoming her to join them and also become good  sweet  and enlightened  nor were there gates  pearly or otherwise which made her smile  as she d always known those were fairy stories and she d never bought into them  nor were there parallel universes where she could peek at her body doubles doing all the things she had thought about but failed to even attempt in her pathetic little life spent reading stacks and stacks of terrible slush pile books as the only sixty five year old editorial assistant in the history of book publishing she d always known she would die there  she d known it was a matter of time until she read a book so horrendous that it killed her  and when she was finished  she would merely drop it on the floor  knowing that she had reached the end  hello   she called into the fog   i m dead  is anybody here  in response  a new door materialized just in front of her and  as it creaked open  she was hit by a puff of familiar smell  books  new books that had become bestsellers after she d rescued them from the slush pile  pushed them on her bosses  and been so annoying that they d finally read them only to take full credit for discovering them  i m very angry   she said to the smell   there is nobody here to greet me  and i m so sick of books  do you think you could take your smell somewhere else  no offense   she added because she d always been a very polite editorial assistant  which is perhaps why she d managed to hang on even through the great recession and blood bath of early      when most of her department had been laid off  but old habits don t disappear just because you croak in response  the smell turned left  she stepped through the new door and turned right  although there really was no such thing in this new world  for twelve hours she walked  although there really was no time and her cheap timex  a gift from her boss  was frozen at the moment she d closed the book  hello   she called  thinking she d spied a figure through the murky fog   hello  can you help me  i think i m dead and i don t know what to do   yes  you are  and you don t have to do anything   said a disembodied voice   you were very polite  you did a good job  but you might have explored a bit more taken some chances if you don t mind some feedback   anything   she answered   i ve always believed in revision  please help me  i m lost

that poem have suddenly returned in a most unexpected way  rare book dealer and beats specialist brian cassidy has found a previously unknown original draft of  howl   this uncorrected carbon typescript is believed to be the very one ginsberg used when he read the poem at reed college in early        at least a year before  howl  became the anthem of the counterculture revolution

ginsberg s masterpiece went through considerable revision before it was published in      by ferlinghetti in  howl and other poems   story   that complex publishing history and the poem s prominence make this    page unrevised version particularly valuable to scholars of   th century poetry   to say that finding an original previously unknown draft of a major american work of literature is unusual is certainly an understatement   cassidy said in a statement   and given that  howl  was famous pretty much from its inception  that an original typescript for it could have been unknown for

me that doesn t end up reading this book  i was so hyped up about this book that i preordered three different versions of it   sorry  bank account   what i didn t expect was to come to the realisation that i didn t actually like nora  it took almost no time at all for me to begin resenting her for squandering her potential  she was intelligent and gifted in various disciplines but she bailed on multiple opportunities that most people could only dream of having  even though i also acknowledged and empathised with the pain she d experienced  it still took a long time for me to stop being distracted by the privilege she took for granted    never underestimate the big importance of small things    i loved the idea of being able to test drive different versions of the life that could have been  although it did raise some questions for me  some were addressed in this book but others are still ticking over in my mind nora inhabits the bodies of a number of different versions of herself  all living lives that could potentially have been hers  when she returns to the library the other noras resume their lives  nora s actions in a borrowed life could easily result in consequences that would derail an aspect of the life of the nora that lives there  and i wondered if i would chance that if i was in her place  i d hate to think that me acting in an unintentionally careless way could have real world consequences for another version of me if someone who has their own version of the midnight library chooses to stay in one of the lives they visit  what happens to the version of themselves who lived there first  do they die  swap existences with the interloper  or is their existence undone entirely  also  if you remain in another version of your life  could you ever truly feel like you belong or would you constantly feel like you need to fake knowing people that weren t a part of your original life i did eventually get over my initial resentment envy of nora s many opportunities and settled into exploring each new possible life with her  there were some lives i wanted to visit longer and others i wanted to escape from almost immediately  it seemed obvious from early on where nora s story was leading  one thing that i hadn t given much thought to in the context of this story prior to reading it was the impact that nora s choices in life  big and small  would have on the other people in her life  in this respect it reminded me of the butterfly effect  although nora s story is nowhere near as dark as evan s  paulo coelho s veronika decides to die and robert frost s the road not taken also popped into my mind as i was reading i wound up thinking a lot about who my mrs elm would be and the form that my midnight library would take  while my library would have books  obviously    i m still not entirely sure who my mrs elm is  i don t know if it s possible to read this book without thinking about your own regrets  equally  i don t know if it s possible to read this book without considering the changes you could make in your life to erase them the story is told quite simply  it seemed to me to be part cautionary tale  part self help book and

 i poked around in mine and realized that i don t feel much regret about the inflection points in my life  things that were hugely disappointing at the time   not being able to go to my top choice college despite getting in  not getting that job in publishing and being so crushed that i went back to school for biology   have faded into insignificance because i like the life i m currently living

journey of finding reasons to continue living after he experienced mental health issues  i haven t read that book but this one is a beautifully imagined foray into what makes life liveable and every human being s quest for that mostly elusive  perfect  life we have all thought back to those moments in our lives when we could have made different choices and wondered how our lives would have turned out if we had  nora seed  struggling to survive  alone  jobless  having lost her cat and estranged from her best friend and brother  gets to explore this possibility for real  at her lowest point  she ends up in the midnight library which has every life she could have ever lived with every choice she could have ever made  what s more  it has a list of all the regrets she has ever had   of not continuing with her brother s band  not studying philosophy  giving up swimming  never fulfilling her dream of being a glaciologist  messing up personal relationships and many many more now she has the chance to choose any of those lives and see which one she would be happiest living  and she does  going through a plethora of choices  being transported into the middle of various existences that are both similar and different from each other  depending on decisions she made the question is what constitutes perfection  would any choice we make guarantee no regrets and permanent happiness  any path of life has good and bad in it and only we can make the most of it  no matter which one we choose  while it s always tempting to believe that in a parallel universe  having done different things  we would have been successful  achieved all our dreams and led wonderful lives  there is a reason why we are in the present  our current journey has relevance for us and everyone who accompanies us on it nora s thoughts during this unexpected opportunity she is afforded resonated very much  i couldn t help relating to her confusion and fear of committing to any of the alternatives she glimpses  what if there was a better option  and besides  can there be an existence that most closely resembles the utopia we hope for for me  the most important message of this story is that there are tradeoffs for every choice made and many times  it is the small things that matter much more than we give them credit for  also  the desire to change things not dependent on our own decisions is at the root of many regrets  once we embrace this idea our best life may be closer than we think     more  it is easy to mourn the lives we aren t living  easy to wish we d developed other other talents  said yes to different offers  easy to wish we d worked harder  loved better  handled our finances more astutely  been more popular  stayed in the band  gone to australia  said yes to the coffee or

didn t do the people we didn t do and the people we didn t marry and the children we didn t have  it is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people  and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be  it is easy to regret  and keep regretting  ad infinitum  until our time runs out but it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem  it is the regret itself  it s the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people s worst enemy we can t tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse  those lives are happening  it is true  but you are happening as well  and that is the happening we have to focus on

about possibilities and exploring these possibilities  it s about having faith and believing and about being clear about what you want  and also about the difference between need and want  afterwards i felt  and continue to be  inspired to change my perception of existence and reality  to think more about the choices i have made and to think about future choices i will have to make which will not only affect me but others i care about too  and to wonder what the other different versions of me are doing right now  the midnight library was powerful  lyrical at times and a fascinating exploration

different had we had  or made  different choices      stars rounded up  overall this was a tolerable read  however it was very full of  messages  and was a bit patronising  it reminded me of the tone

jay kristoff and amy haufman  i enjoyed the different philosophies and radical thoughts brought up in nora s discussions sometimes with mrs  elm and sometimes with the cast of characters in a particular life since nora wakes up to a different life except she remains a version of herself  a slider in different lives while her root life is on the verge of death  there are times i found it a little too cheesy though  haha  or i guess i just expected too much  still  it s definitely worth the read  there are so many quotable lines about life and living  here s one     you don t have to

to say about it  other than it was ok  i appreciate the message it conveyed  but i don t know   it just was a bit  meh  and too frequently i found myself skimming pages  it felt to me like every page had an  inspirational quote  on it and  in my opinion  it also felt like it almost  simplified  mental health and how easily it can be  fixed  which didn t sit well with me i know i m one of the very

repetitive  it just sounded the same every time  there were tons of dialogue and i don t have much patience with characters talking  in short  i found the writing dull and it just never grabbed my

makes me see matt haig in a whole new light  he s a quiet genius  the midnight library finds us with our main character  nora seed  at her lowest point   her dark night of the soul  if you will  magically  she enters this library with thousands and thousands of books on a conveyor belt  books that allow her  and us  to jump in and out of different lives   all belonging to her  it s quite the ride and you never know where it s going to take nora  or you as the reader   but it s more than that  much more than that  there is so much to learn in the midnight library  there s so much to understand and experience if you give yourself over to the experience  you start to realize that nothing is as it seems  nor should it be  you also realize that living is a choice you make based on your reality  but your reality is much more than the one dimension you see  especially if you are caught up in a lot of noise or a lot of silence  all in all  i loved this book  i loved every page of this book  there were a few moments that seemed to drag on and i can tell that the author got a little carried away in certain spots  but it was well worth the read for the simple way it integrated psychology  philosophy and counseling into this crazy time traveling type story  i feel that some could read the midnight library and definitely be unfazed by it and not see the uniqueness contained therein  however  i also feel like those who can ignore the vision that matt haig is trying to set for the reader probably has never had a reason to pick up a book by matt haig in the first place  i

worlds of what her life could have been  i don t get emotional often  rarely  during books  but this one knocked me down and then continued to hit me  i cried and fell in love with this book  the midnight library has found a special place in my heart and i will tell everyone about it and pass on the beauty of this story  this is now the second time i ve read this within four months and this is still the emotional impact that it has  if not more  the love and detail that is placed into this story really lets me know that there is a lot of love and care that went into this story to reach people like me and i appreciate that  haig went through each story that nora goes through with such care and detail  this is a story that really encourages someone to keep going no matter what is going on  this is one of those stories that i loved and want everyone to read  but i don t know how to properly put my love and emotion from this story into words to explain to others why they should read it  not only that  i feel like this is a hard story to talk about without spoiling the whole thing  so please  take my word for it and read this book  put some blind faith in me and pick up this book  even though it does have content that can be triggering  for me and a few others i know  this book is also oddly comforting and healing      more   stars thanks to edelweiss and viking for

well nora was given that chance  in the middle of a possible suicide  nora suddenly wakes in a library  for nora this was her home base  with a dear old friend mrs  elm as her guide  and this midnight library was full of books  more than the eye could see  and each book was a different version of her life  she only had to pick and she was able to spend time living those various alternate lives   lives she might have had  had she made a different decision  altered her actions  but what was nora looking for in all those lives   what was she missing in her root life  i thoroughly enjoyed this book  there are books that come to us at just the right time in our life  for me  this was one of those books  the authors use of magical realism was  in my opinion  the best part of this book  he

though we re following her story  she could really be anyone  you re given enough details where you can connect to her as a character and the journey she s on  but her feelings are very relatable and

wonder  don t we  what our lives might look like now if we d turned left instead of right   if this thing had happened but not that thing   of course  a novel like this is all about the journey  and

stories of her life not lived  guided by the librarian  who reflects a part of her past  nora tries on some of those lives for size  a process that changes her understanding of her life in many ways   on a personal note  it definitely served as a reflective tool for me  i think we all from time to time picture how different our lives could ve been had we have done things differently and taken up different opportunities  this book solidifies the fact that there is nothing you can do about your past  but you have every chance and opportunity for your future  your life is a continuous blank page and you can change things at any time the midnight library is kind of  it s a wonderful life  for the modern age  written with the deep insight into certain aspects of the human condition that matt haig is known for  beautifully crafted  and offers the reader many thought provoking ideas  it s a novel you will drift off with into thoughts of your own life decisions  whilst constantly being brought back to nora and hers although the topic of the book was quite heavy  the tone of the book was uplifting and funny therefore made it a very easy read and easier to consume the topics which were being spoken about i don t think i could profess enough about how much i love this book  it s become a new all time favorite and i can t thank matt haig enough for so perfectly capturing my own

when i first started this book  i immediately felt quite underwhelmed  it was not following the story i was expecting it to  the premise promised libraries  infinite choices and parallel universes  which made me count on something similar to  the starless sea  by erin morgenstein  after reading a few chapters  i put it off for   months  until one day i decided to give it another chance  which led to me to binge reading this book in one day  this book was enjoyable  though repetitive at times  i had a fun time reading most of it  so if you ve been interested in this novel for a while  i can tell you it s definitely worth a try what really struck my interest was the idea of this library where you can visit your past regrets and undo them in a parallel universe  i really enjoy seeing this type of concept explored  hence this book pick  i applaud matt haig for coming up with this idea and linking it with mental health issues and philosophical questions  the different lives we get to experience along with our main character nora seed are diverse  which brings a lot of variety  as a result of these experiences  nora seed often learns a new lesson  which gives the reader perspective  for example  after nora has  undid  a few of her regrets in her parallel lives  she ultimately gets to the conclusion that all this time  she shouldn t have felt so bad about these regrets  she realizes that she should ve focused on her current life instead of worrying about the past  thus  we  as readers  get this life lesson too nevertheless  a common risk with this type of concept is predictability  when we follow the main character as she specifically chooses a regret she wants to undo  it is often very easy to predict what will follow  there isn t a wide variety of plot twists  which led me to predicting most of the plot  that s the main reason why i was struggling with the book in the beginning as well  however  when you get in the right mood  this book can be quite addicting to read despite this flaw the main topic of this novel is depression and suicide  because these are very serious illnesses  i was a bit sceptic about how the author would represent it in his book  when i found out matt haig had fought his own battle with depression and anxiety  i was more assured  generally i found that the main character s mental health problems were represented quite realistically  nonetheless  the ending disappointed me quite a bit  there isn t a  set  cure to depression  there are different aspects to getting better  simply deleting your regrets will not solve everything  but it did come off that way with this book  which can be disappointing for some people  the mental health representation in this book might be different for every reader  depending on their own experiences and views on life this book is written in first person  which i believe was the perfect choice  the author took us to nora seed s life changing experience through her eyes  slowly building up everything  because of matt haig s choice of narrative voice we learn how each experience impacts the main character s life  which brings things into perspective  however  the author found multiple chances throughout the book to give us a long speech about depression  life and anxiety which comes off very unnatural  an example of this can be found when she lives her life as an olympic champion and has to give a ted talk  the author used this opportunity to give a   page monologue  even though it did not bother me that much  it did come off as a self help book during those scenes which was not what i was expecting in conclusion  it was an enjoyable read with a fun concept  if the premise sounds like something you might be interested in  i can definitely recommend it  once i got into this book  it felt like the real world disappeared and i found myself in this fictional world  even though it might not be everyone s cup of tea  it definitely brings you some escapism      more i plucked this off a supermarket shelf because it was       or   for     so i chucked the latest billy connolly paperback into my trolley too and then went off to get my washing

books of all the lives she might have lived were she to have made different decisions along the way  inevitably  it prompts you to think about you own life in this way  matt haig has very cleverly woven some important and uplifting insights into a lightly told story  i doubt it would have much impact on anyone in the grip of serious depression but for those brought low by circumstance  or just in a bit of a trough  it may well bring some cheer and comfort     more nora seed hasn t had the best week  in fact let s just say that she hasn t had the best life  her brother who is the only family

midnight on a tuesday  or maybe that was all you needed  nora tries life after life but she always ends up not liking it or being a stranger in her own life no matter how popular or how successful or how rich she is and always ends up back at the library  mrs elm smiled  wryly   it just shows you  doesn t it   shows me what   well  that you can choose choices but not outcomes  but i stand by what i said  it was a good choice  it just wasn t a desired outcome   then mrs elm tells nora that maybe she should try lives where the regrets weren t obvious  even after trying those lives and even liking one where she thought that it could be her new life  she still ends up at the midnight library and at last she understands that she won t feel at home in any of her other lives because even though technically all of those are her lives  practically she didn t live them   are there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change  she does get fresh perspective through her journey and she also realizes that she wants to live  never underestimate the big importance of small things  she wakes up in her root life and decides to turn everything around as her perspective has

writing and i was engrossed from the very beginning  i didn t like nora in the beginning but she grew on me and i was rooting for her throughout  i felt her journey like it was my own journey  how

writing is preachy  and since you don t get to meet the side characters more than a few short chapters at a time they practically have no development  and the library isn t used as much as i wanted it to  so that s another disappointment there are times that you re like  oh  this life seems nice  but then you look at the page number and see that half of the book is left  so you think  the life must end in a few chapters  and then not care about it or its  moral  at all  the ending was also too happy to be realistic  sometimes  things won t get better  i did not hate this book  it was just   fine

will stay with me for a long time  not only is a literary fiction book but it is a self help book  it is very cleverly written  for me personally after reading this book made me think of things

months to come through because this book on this christmas day      was exactly what i needed   starts humming starman  idk i just got that feeling  this book is perfect  an absolute delight to read

at ending it  she winds up at  the midnight library  which contains books about an infinite amount of lives nora could live had she made different decisions  nora tries on her possible lives through the books in the midnight library  and each chapter takes the reader through many of the possibilities the problem for me is that i loved the idea more than the execution  in the first     or so when nora was going through her various lives  i was feeling optimistic about where the book was going  and i thought that her choices on what to change were done in a realistic way based on the complaints she was making at the beginning  however  i would say that the book really took a turn for me at the point where she tries on a life where she is a glaciologist  i understand that it is virtually impossible for the author to build up and explain in the beginning of the book every single faucet of the main character  but this desire of hers came out of nowhere and was based on nothing  i do realize that perhaps the only reason she had to try on this life was because she met a character in those related chapters who shows up a few times in her other lives  but even that to me seems very far fetched  in addition to his character being kind of unnecessary in general  not only could i not get over how highly unlikely it would be for her to meet this character multiple times in a universe where she was told she has infinite lives  but i also could not get past the fact that there was no uniformity between these different lives  in every single life nora tried on  it felt like the core of her being drastically changed  such that the  root  nora was always out of place  and yes  i understand that life experiences can change people completely  but it felt like she changed a little bit too much  its no wonder she couldn t get into any of the lives because she couldn t even recognize herself  ever  this also made me feel disconnected to her character  this was obviously done on purpose to give the reader that predictable ending we know is coming  but i was not a fan i guess the other main thing that made me feel nothing towards nora though is the fact that she has absolutely no goal  her whole thing was that she wanted to be happy  but she has no definition of what that could mean to her  i also really disliked how every single time she jumped into a new life  she found a way to give someone in that life a motivational speech about   living other lives  or  what i would do in another life    she brought this up every chapter  and it got old  fast  the book was more about inspirational quotes than actual plot  i love that matt haig uses his platform to advocate for mental health  but i m just confused because the messaging i got from this book was that having a more positive outlook on your life and realizing all the good in what you have can  cure  your depression  when that s not really the case  i can see why people would like this book   it has a really motivational approach and definitely makes you reflect on your own live and decisions  however  in terms of the actual plot  it just wasn t for me     more i found the midnight library an

actually  so i ll say that i expected more humor from this author  as i ve read him in the past  one thing i ve loved about him is he can tackle difficult themes while throwing in enough humor that i remember the book with a smile  this one didn t have much humor at all  but i very much enjoyed it  again  i don t want to throw spoilers  let s say that nora has a chance to choose books  and thus  different lives  and some of those at one point became a bit tiresome for me because of the nature of those different stories  nora was born with many gifts and talents  as are all of us  depending upon which of those she chooses to focus on  her life goes in many different directions  a couple of those didn t interest me much  and that s where the book became tiresome for me  and why it loses a star  saying all that though  this is a thought provoking read  and while some dark themes are covered  including depression  which the author understands well because he s been there  it ends on a high note  it is definitely worth your time and would make a great book club discussion read  we have all had events or decisions that we would either undo or change the timing of  and it is fascinating to explore that  if that sounds interesting to you  then you would enjoy this book eta  i want to add that the audio version was well done too  it for me was also a four star performance

followers  no friend requests  she was antimatter  with added self pity no way am i going to spoil for you what the midnight library was but when it was revealed to me as a reader  i literally felt delighted at the concept  it was fresh and unique but also  i believed in the idea of it  for this story  the stories within the story were all about possiblity  the what ifs  the second guesses  the fantasies and the maybes  it was hard to look up from the page did i have a favourite possiblity or character  maybe but i think i always knew where it was going to end and that felt just right matt

are talking abo this is the second novel  ahem  self help book  i have read by matt haig  this is the second book of his i have not liked  considering how uninterested in cheap platitudes i am  i don

do with it  i figured maybe the last book was a fluke  also  the premise sounded very interesting  we are talking about a never ending library  with infinite number of books in it    i mean i thought what s not to like  ummm  as it turned out  a lot this is the story of nora seed  a    year old woman who suffers from depression and is living a life full of regrets  full of missed opportunities  an acquaintance she runs into tells her  she doesn t actually have stage fright  she has life fright  she takes her own life  and enters the midnight library  a place where all her alternate lives are presented to her in the form of infinite books  she can pick any up  enter it and live a different life  if she finds that life disappointing  she can come back and try again  if she finds a life she s happy in  she gets to stay and live it this premise does have potential  there is a lot that can be done with the parallel universes concept  there is a lot that has been done and done well with the parallel universes concept  but speaking of  missed opportunities   matt haig s execution of this premise is very very poor  first of all  this book is painfully predictable  i think at about      within the first couple of visits to the first couple of parallel lives  i knew exactly where the story was going  then i went on to hope that i m wrong  i hoped that it wouldn t be that obvious and heavy handed and hallmark movie like  and surely the book is not trying to say exactly what the classic      christmas movie i had just watched the week before during the holidays said but much better    years ago  you know i m talking about  it s a wonderful life   right    so imagine the compounding disappointment as chapter after chapter we approached the mind numbingly obvious and much over taught life lesson that has been done a million times already secondly  the book was repetitive and boring  and not just because you already guessed the destination  but unfortunately the journey itself  as we follow nora from book to book  life to life  during the first    rd of the book  each parallel life takes a chapter or two to go through  and that was boring enough  but at some point  as if to make sure we hadn t missed the painfully obvious point being made  we go through a dizzying chapter where each of the lives nora enters is introduced in one line  then one phrase  each life more random and meaningless than the last  and as one happens after another  after another  it dawned on me  i just don t care  i don t care what she chooses  i don t care what happens to her  i just care about how many chapters are left third  apparently this author has never heard of  show  don t tell   i mean his attempts at teaching us exactly what the life lessons are and ensuring that we ve really got them by taking a mallet and hitting us repeatedly over the head with it  got embarrassing after a while  even for a self help book disguised as fiction  i mean one of the last chapters of the book is literally titled   a thing i have learned  written by a nobody who has been everybody    i mean  are you kidding me this chapter reminded me of an equally embarrassing chapter in the humans titled   advice for a human  which had    bullet points of advice about how to live  and that chapter also came at the end of the book  dear matt haig  i don t know how to tell you this  i feel like i need to repeat it    times here  because i don t think you re a strong believer of people hearing one another when something is said once or twice  but please believe me when i tell you  we get it             we got it the first time  then again the second time  then the third  now when i say i get it  it doesn t mean i agree  or that the life lessons are meaningful  there were quite a few fundamental flaws here  let s get into them  spoilers ahead  let s start with the mechanics of the midnight library  the whole concept of the library detecting when nora experiences disappointment in a life she has entered  and catapulting her back to the library in order to try a different life made no sense  the setup alone guarantees failure time after time  because the mind numbingly obvious thing here is that there is no life where there exists not one single moment of disappointment  i mean are there people out there that don t know that   however  there are some lives where there are small and fleeting disappointments and the person is able to bounce back from them easily  and then there are other lives that the disappointments are so large  so crippling  that they appear to be gripping the person every moment of every day  so i don t understand this concept of  if you feel disappointment  then you re taken out of a life   of course  if that s the case  then the library is nothing like what it was advertised  it isn t actually there to allow you to go back  make a different decision and live another life  it s just a television that allows you to watch snippets of your other lives  in an attempt to get you to love what you already have  i mean  specifically  in this story  nora finds a life she loves  a life she doesn t want to let go  and then she s yanked out of it anyway  so ummm  is this library a fraud then  see what i mean about poor execution of an interesting concept  i felt like the author was so adamantly focusing on proving that  we should love our lives with whatever disappointments in them  because there is no life that doesn t have any   that he forgot the point of lives only being meaningful when we have free will to live them  if nora was given the choice of if when to exit a life  then it could have been something more logical another issue i had with the way the midnight library was set up was that there was no incentive to actually try and commit to a life  when in the back of your mind you know that there are an endless number of lives waiting for you to jump in or out of  at any time  how do you ever commit to stay in one life forever  when you know an infinite number of options are calling your name  again  i thought it was a much too obvious attempt to set up nora for failure  to make it so that she would arrive at the heavy handed conclusion that none of the endless options are the one she wants except the one she already had  it was just very manipulative and obviously  the grand life lesson here of course is that the life you hated so much that you decided to end is actually  ahem   a wonderful life   but there was a crap load of other life lessons in this book  most of which i found quite nonsensical for example  one life lesson i didn t agree with or appreciate  as nora hops from one parallel life to the next  she discovers that in some she has achieved big success  from being an olympic gold medalist  to being a very famous rock star  to a professor at cambridge university  to a great scientist  to a ceo  she experiences them all  and guess what  every single life is a no go  they re all different shades of  disappointing   and why  well  apparently because every single regret she has in life  every time she goes back to a fork in the road and takes the other path to undo a regret  she discovers that none of the things she supposedly missed out on were her dreams  they were all other people s dreams  it was her dad that wanted her to be an olympian  it was her brother who wanted her to be a musician  it was her fianc  who wanted her to be a pub owner in the country  it was her friend who wanted her to live in australia  heck  it was the school librarian who dared to open her mouth and suggest to her that perhaps she could use that brain of hers and study science and become a glaciologist  and why did these horrible people dare to suggest to a young impressionable girl what to be  ummm could it be because she was good at swimming  good at music  good at science  ummm could it be that literally that is the point of parents  family  friends  and teachers  to guide us  help us discover our potentials  and support us as we cultivate them then we go on to experience lives where nora pursues the paths their  guidance  put her on to discover  obviously  that those lives are miserable anyway  because they were not her dreams she was living  but someone else s  ok  sure  but are we forgetting that the life where she didn t pursue their dreams and instead decided to pursue her own dreams  wait  did she have any   didn t turn out so hot either  i m sorry but what bs life lesson is this  also  i m just sick and tired of reading book after book where the life lesson is that the alternate life in which you re a go getter  where you re more successful  fitter  richer  more educated  looked up to  admired  etc  is all just smokes and mirror and in reality in those lives you re miserable  because  that s the price of success   misery is the price you must pay  ummm  no  maybe this concept sells books  as most of us are average joe s and we like to hear that the others  those who achieved things we didn t  secretly wish for our lives  just as we wish for theirs  and yes  i have heard of the saying  grass is always greener   but honestly dude  whatever helps you sleep at night  and apparently  whatever helps you sell lots of books i would really like to read a book where we acknowledge that there are people who actually do have it all  ambition  extreme level of success  as well as happiness  love  family  adoration  and there are also people who make all the right decisions and try very hard  and yet don t achieve the level of success they  deserve   it is not pick one or the other  success or love happiness is not some fork in the road  there are people who have both  there are people who have neither  that is the reality of this world  there is a level of  the luck of the draw  that is simply at play as well  i m certainly not saying you don t have free will to make things happen for yourself and that you re born to be successful or happy or not   but i am saying this is a very complex concept  there are so many moving pieces at play  the country you re born in  the family you re born in  your level of health and abilities  as well as your attitude  your lifestyle  your ambition  and your mistakes  they re all playing a part  this is an endlessly complex concept that this book was not even able to scratch the surface of a final life lesson that i also had a big problem with  the book is appearing to have this  important  message that if you change your perspective  all the ugliness you were seeing can start to look beautiful  a life you wanted to end one day becomes a life of endless possibilities you cannot wait to go back to  you will literally run through a building on fire  with the roof caving in on your head  to get another crack at it  and you ll soon wonder why you couldn t see it all before  she didn t need a vineyard or a californian sunset to be happy  she didn t even need a large house and the perfect family  she just needed potential  and she was nothing if not potential  she wondered why she had never seen it before  this whole idea of  change your perspective  chin up girl  the world is beautiful if you just stop to smell the roses   is a very inappropriate form of messaging in regards to depression  i m not an expert  but i do know enough to at least acknowledge that depression is a mental health condition  it is a disease  it requires treatment  it is not enough to  get perspective  and  see life s potential   no  you cannot shake it off  before you remind me that the author himself had depression for a time  let me tell you that i know that already  and that s why i m even more flabbergasted by this type of messaging to be honest with you  the only thing this book had going for it was that it was relatively short  i do not recommend this book  and next time my bookclub tries to vote for one of his books  i m gonna put my foot down     more before i start with the actual review can i just say that i am confused about why this is a  fiction  book instead of  fantasy  or at least  magical realism  and was the winner for fiction for the goodreads award  because let s face it    th of the book is pure fantastical thinking i do not understand how genres are decided on goodreads at all trigger warning  before i get into the actually review  let me just mention that the start of this book could be very triggering for people that have thou before i start with the actual review can i just say that i am confused about why this is a  fiction  book instead of  fantasy  or at least  magical realism  and was the winner for fiction for the goodreads award  because let s face it    th of the book is pure fantastical thinking i do not understand how genres are decided on goodreads at all trigger warning  before i get into the actually review  let me just mention that the start of this book could be very triggering for people that have thoughts about self harm or struggle with that topic  because its pretty descriptive in that and also shows a lot of negative and what i call ugly thinking of putting yourself down  and while some of those things   the negative thoughts mostly  are addressed throughout the book  the actual self harm and trying to take your life is never addressed in a good way  in my option  its basically just  solved  by the lessons learned in the lifes  but its never discussed that you should seek help  talk to someone and try to find someone to help yourself  that being said  haig did write this book in a readable and light tone  so once you get over those first few moments  it gets lighter  and those moments are pretty fun and interesting and different and had a lovely plot idea and overall some good messages and little quotable sayings in it it shares a lot of truth about most of not all peoples life s  it mentions a good amount of people can be struggling but in ways nobody else sees i also love how there is a lot of empathizes made on how small changes can make a big impact and that dreams or hopes or wishes might not always be what we always dreamed them up to be it s just a good book full of wonderful sentiments that  yes sure  are nothing new at all but are still nice to hear or read and be reminded of every once in a while i also absolutely love that the main character is in her thirties and still trying to figure out life   it s not something that just happens once you reach this magic age number  you can still try to find yourself at any age even if other people don t understand that or pretend to not understand it or even pretend that they have it together themselves when really they don t   if you aim to be something you are not  you will always fail  aim to be you  aim to look and act and think like you  aim to be the truest version of you  embrace that you ness  endorse it  love it  work hard at it  and don t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it  most gossip is envy in disguise  keep your head down  keep your stamina up  keep swimming  i also liked how this book discusses dealing with expectations how we are constantly bombarded with other peoples hopes and dreams and wishes and being pushed and pulled into those directions from childhood on parents maybe even unconsciously push kids into specific directions or out of specific directions and that really does impact people  it was nice to see it mentions that sometimes finding what you really want is very hard because sometimes that want has never played a role or was always quieted or drowned out by the noice of other people  prison wasn t the place  it the perspective  what i didn t enjoy so much  was the we spend very little time actually getting to know the main character and get actual life and how she got to the point she ist at that she tries to take her own life and ends up in the library  the book starts with her thinking about killing herself and really starts when she does and lands in the midnight library i wish we would have gotten a bit more then the negatively shaded few pages of her actual life to really understand the character better  the book worked without that but i can see people struggling with just being dumped into the hardest part of a characters life and then going straight into the jumping into other life options i also had issues with the actual life jumping why would you be dumped into a life without also getting the knowledges needed for that life   of course you won t be happy in the life you have no clue how to live  you can t possibly be a scientist if you have no clue how to do that  you need that knowledge so why would the library dump someone into the body of that life but not give the memories as well so that the life makes sense it would also show that every life has struggles and issues and might seem perfect at the first glance but it was still hard work everything in this book would have worked just as well of the character would have to get used to the lives but with background knowledge of each of the lives it just bothered me because it was so clearly plotted to make the ending the book so overly clear  view spoiler   because of course you want to go back to what you know and try to change that for the better instead of trying to learn for example years of university knowledge over a few weeks while in the middle of nowhere because you are in the middle of an experiment where you need that learned knowledge but don t have it  that too hard and not possible  and i felt like every life she tried she lacked the information that would help her actually make a real decision if that life would suit her better if she had info s about that life and how she got there  but without it  nothing makes sense it s hard and uncomfortable and why would you literally choose the life of a stranger that makes no sense    hide spoiler  so i wish that would been done better and more written in a way that it would have been a real choice between different options and not rigged to make it very hard to basically impossible for most lives seen in this book and as i already mentioned in the warning at the beginning of the book  i wish the actual suicide would have been addressed  nora tried to kill herself and was very close to actually killing herself  but its never mentioned that there are options and help available  that she needs help afterwards too  that she can t just go home and never think about having tried to kill herself  but should seek out help in some way  its great that the library gave her back her will to live  but you need more if you are depressed and suicidal  and i think that should have been addressed more  its a book about that topic  that actively shows self harm  so it should also talk about what can help to not go there and after all that complaining i do really think this book so well done and well written i liked the aspects of this place  in between  where one person that had a big impact on your life is once again there to help you when you need it most  i think that most reads will get some enjoyment out of it and have a good time reading it  so definitely worth a try if you are not triggered by the topic     more unable to endure life any more  nora seed takes an overdose  and finds herself in the midnight library   a place between life and

 nora seed takes an overdose  and finds herself in the midnight library   a place between life and death  where she has the chance to undo her regrets and live multiple other lives that she could have lived had she made different decisions in her root life  what for instance if she had not given up swimming  or had pursued her one time dream of being in a band  or what if she had not broken off her engagement to dan  with the help of mrs elm  her former school librarian  nora finds herself trying out some of these different lives  however  will she find a life she actually wants to live i absolutely loved the concept of this book  i m sure everyone of us has at some point wondered what if i had chosen that path instead  that idea of the  grass is always greener   this book takes that concept and runs with it  it also tackles some really important and weighty issues in relation to mental health  a subject matter that i understand the author has personal experience of and has drawn inspiration from in other works too  given the subject matter  the beginning of the book does have quite a dreary feel to it  and some readers might find it upsetting  personally  i think haig approaches the book with quite a light  almost whimsical writing style  which for me ensured the book never felt too dark and made it quite an easy read  on the downside though  i did find that the writing style perhaps added to the emotional disconnect that i had a problem with throughout the book  and which i will elaborate on further later in the review one of the things i personally thought was conveyed really well in the first section of the book before nora takes the overdose  is how haig makes it clear that nora feels she is of no worth to anyone  having experience of working in mental health  one of the things that health professionals always explore  is  protective factors  i e  what is there that might stop someone going though with any suicidal thoughts  whilst thoughts of family and loved ones is the most commonly identified factor  pets are often another  in that they give people a sense of responsibility and being needed and haig highlighted that really well i thought  in that nora felt without her cat and without the neighbour needing her to do his weekly shop  there wasn t anyone she had any responsibility towards  there wasn t anyone she thought needed her  i liked how haig also came back to this idea towards the end of the story  as in another life  nora realises that without her help her neighbour ends up in a residential home  and that she was actually instrumental in helping him keep his independence  likewise  one of the young boys she tutors in her root life  in another life without this  ends up getting into trouble with the law  again highlighting the positive impact she was having on someone without truly realizing it  i liked this idea of how our lives interconnect with other peoples  in a myriad different ways  and that sometimes small things we do  may have more impact then we realize  i liked how the book explores how we can set up our expectations of ourselves to be too high  and also how we often base this on other peoples  expectations of us  particularly in a modern society where social media plays such an important role in many peoples  lives  people can place huge pressures on themselves  which can affect their mental wellbeing  one of the things nora realizes as the story goes on and she tries out these different lives  is that quite often the things she didn t pursue and thought she regretted weren t actually her own dreams  but other peoples  dreams  but that in not having taken them up she was weighed down in guilt  yet when she lived the lives where she pursued these dreams  they didn t make her happy and so those regrets she had been carrying melted away  the book also highlights how ultimately it is our own perceptions of life that is the most important thing  as life itself is never going to be perfect  but one has to find and draw on the positives before us i did find that the endless lives nora takes up became somewhat repetitive and predictable in terms of knowing that nora would eventually become unhappy in them  also so much of the book is taken up with nora living out different versions of herself  that it makes it harder to appreciate the  true  nora and to connect to her  for me  this is where i struggled with the book  in that i never connected to nora  hard as i tried to  i think this was probably down to a combination of things  including the writing style as mentioned earlier  as well as there being too many versions of nora  and that she seemed to be defined more by what she did in any particular life rather than just who she was as a person herself  nor were there any secondary characters that i felt connected to or emotionally invested in  as again they either change too much between lives  or just aren t developed enough as characters e g  ash or nora s brother also i appreciate the idea of us having endless possibility within us  but the fact that so many of nora s lives were so extraordinary e g  being a popstar  or an olympic athlete  was just a tad unrealistic  and whilst i appreciate the book by its very nature is not exactly based in realism   though actually haig did try to allude to quantum physics with regards to the whole idea of multiverses   i just thought nora s lives didn t need to be so extreme  of course there are more ordinary versions of her life that we also see  and actually the one she is the happiest in for longest  is not necessarily the one where she is the richest or most successful  but the one in which feels loved and loves in turn  which i liked overall  i was more impressed by the concepts behind the book rather than the execution  and for me personally  it didn t quite live up to all the rave reviews i had read  still i appreciated the life lessons to be learned from the book  even if i thought they perhaps could have been more subtly presented     more martie s rating  three and a half starsgenre  literary women s fictionpublisher  penguin random housepub  date  feb          for

the title   the midnight library   the novel did not disappoint  it reminded me of the film   it s a wonderful life   the book is marketed as literary women s fiction  this reviewer did not think it was either  it is more of a fantasy and feel good read  the fact that this is a heartwarming tale is interesting because the novel begins with a young woman who has just overdosed on purpose  she wakes up to find herself not in heaven or hell but an immensely large magical library  did i mention that she is an avid reader and spent most of her childhood in a library  yes  there is a connection  it turns out that this library is the place people go when they find themselves dangling between life and death and not entirely sure about which way to go  i get that a religious person would take issue with this concept  however  if you believe in quantum physics and that we live in multiple universes at the same time you will be thrilled to know that there are other believers out there  there is even mention of schr dinger s cat  it is okay if you never heard of the cat  it will be explained to you  in this magical library  our protagonist meets a kindly librarian who shows her her very own  book of regrets   we all have them  now here comes the fantasy  she jumps into each life where she could make a different choice than she did before and that would lead her to a happier existence  in one life  she is a rock star  in another  she is an olympic swimmer  in yet another  she is a happily married wife and mother  still  she doesn t care to live any of these better lives because it becomes clear that she doesn t know what she wants  at first reading her alternate lives were fun  who hasn t wished they could jump into another life  but  after a while  it becomes tedious to read one after another  i would have been happier with fewer lives  still  the author manages to keep the story fun because when the protagonist enters a new life  she knows nothing of it  she must look for herself online and read her social media accounts to know who she exactly is in each particular life  which creates humorous dialogue as we observe her winging it  the author seems to be saying that the universe is full of infinite possibilities  but the story here remains tightly focused on the life of a single woman and all her might have been lives  once you finish the book  or probably before  the moral of the story becomes obvious   oh  auntie em   there s no place like home   my only real issue in this tale was thinking about people who lost someone to suicide  how painful it could be reading this fantasy and wishing that their loved one could have also time traveled to come back to life  this magical tale seems to imply that those who kill themselves and fail to come back to life did not love the people they left behind enough to do so  overall  it is clear that haig pushes his readers to ponder his or her own book of regrets  and make us wonder what we can do to keep from making the same mistakes again  he gets her point across very well  i received this advance review copy  arc  novel from the publisher at no cost in exchange for an honest review find all my book
